There are a number of other books that are far better and more insightful. I'm not passing this book on to friends. I'll give it to the library instead.",

She has lived with abuse all of her life with her alcoholic mother and her many boyfriends, and she is reliving it all over again with her fianc&eacute; Robert. Finally, one day after being abused she sees the light and decides to leave before her wedding and go to look for refuge with her Aunt Lydia, a woman who has tried to help her in the past.In living with Lydia, Julia also gets to know a group of women who will help her find herself and heal her soul and her body in the process. Unfortunately, for me, a lot of these characters were just too out there in regards to the psychic nights and the ability to find strength in their private body parts! I mean, who does that?! It's fun to be quirky but this was just a little too bizarre and kind of killed the story for me.Julia, of course manages to find love and her talent in the midst of some serious situations.While this book is indeed filled with warmth and love, I just could not get into the characters lives, thankfully so I guess since most of them are dealing with some very serious issues.  I wanted to like this book but in the end, I was just glad that it was over.",

I was especially interested since this man is a scientist and doctor and didn't believe it when his patients told him what they saw in their own NDE. I did read many of the reviews before I purchased the book so I was aware that the author did not detail a lot of his actual experience and what he saw in Heaven, but I was still very excited to read it. The author describes his experience in the Core, the Gateway and the realm of the earthworm's eye view. He did not explain what the Core or Gateway was. He used these words, but what exactly are they and where did he get those terms? He describes the first place he goes to as being in mud with blood and veins as if he were a worm in muck. That was confusing and strange. There was very little description or explanation of what he saw. I am glad to have read the book, happy that he is getting his message out, and I do believe him, but this book leaves the reader unsatisfied in my opinion. Anita Moorjani's \"Dying To Be Me\" was a better book for help from her heavenly visit. She gives more details and it is a better story all around.",

I&#8217;ll also say that I&#8217;d heard little about the book when it came out because I&#8217;m truly not into videos or MTV, or television for that matter. I&#8217;m a writer, in fact, and I like to read different genres.Confessions of a Video Vixen is not a cautionary tale meant to deter women from the pitfalls of the entertainment industry. The book is simply a poorly written tell all&#8217;. The title of the book itself is a farce. Video Vixen? There were less than ten pages in entire book that referenced her video career and as far as the vixen part, well let&#8217;s just say that vixen would not be a word I&#8217;d use to describe Ms. Steffans.So many things disturbed me about Ms. Steffans&#8217; story, everything from the abuse she sustained at the hands of her mother, to being raped, to running away, to exotic dancing at the age of seventeen; it sickened me. Then when she marries Kook G Rap her entire life became even more sordid and pitiable.There were also so many contradictions in this book, the main one being of course Ms. Steffans praying for a child so the child would make her better person and make her change her life. Right&#8230;Don&#8217;t let this story fool you into believing Ms. Steffans was a victim. This woman had every opportunity to make a career for herself, but instead she chose the easy life, have sex with famous people and get paid for it; the world&#8217;s oldest profession thrives!If I had to judge the first one third of the book, I&#8217;d say it was a 3.5 for her story of her childhood was compelling, as far as the rest of the book, it was a major letdown. I give Confessions of a Video Vixen two stars.",

    "reviewText": "Karrine Steffans tells the story of her abusive childhood, drug and alcohol addiction, and sexual relationships with various celebrities. All of this makes her story an entertaining read, but Steffans leaned on the explicit nature of her story to sell the book. The writing was mediocre at best, with chapters ending on awkward phrases and whole paragraphs in which the person she is talking to/about is unclear.I understand that Steffans felt that she had a specific message to get across to her readers and maybe stylistic writing was not her main focus. It seemed that she was more focused on simply telling the story rather than on the way the story is told. However, I felt that this decreased the impact of her story.I thought the last chapter and epilogue of the book were disappointing. The last chapter was contradictory, with Steffans saying how much she's changed but still regressing to her old ways with Usher. She justifies her behavior by saying she \"felt free to be adventurous\" with Usher because of their past relationship. She did walk out of Usher's hotel room, but it seemed like it was only after finding out he was with another woman next door. The ending of the last chapter made the epilogue weak.In the epilogue she says the difference in her lifestyle is that now she is her \"own woman and looks for no one to complete her.\" There was nothing in the last chapter or the entire book that showed this change and frankly, I don't believe her.",

From there it deteriorates, after a second kidnapping, into a kind of self-serving, poor-me kind of tale which as I said above is redundant, redundant.  I felt sorry for Molly's husband, as I was as sick of her and her activities as he seemed to be.  The characters were like people from a thirty minute Twilight Zone script, only not as well developed.  I'm laughing at this because it is such a great description.  At least I can entertain myself.

Anyhow, how do you say that your walking the AT, and end up skipping over half of it and driving parts that you do say you are walking. I think that the author needs also to have a lesson in respect. Not everyone that he encounters can be stupid, ignorant, and should be made fun of.But then again, none of us will never understand his thinking of being much better, smarter, and wiser than the few people he did meet on his little walk. I found myself hoping through the last of the book that he would at least encounter his tremendous fear of &quot; A bear in the woods&quot;. At least it would have maybe brought some delight to the reading, and who knows, with his apparent fear, he might have made it all the way across the AT......... running.

All of the characters were underdeveloped and I had no real sense of who these people really were. I found it impossible to feel any emotion for any of them or connect in any way. How the characters or story makes me feel, or how well I'm entertained is how I measure  whether or not a book is good.  The only chracter who had a tiny measure of personality was Molly's husband Cole and he came off as an absentee husband, a self centered whiner, and a jerk.  The plot was meandering, the characters all lacked depth, the suspense was low-level at best and at worst, completely non-existant. By the time I slogged through all of the side issues, I was bored and really didn't care any more 'who done it'.  I'm glad I got the book on sale for .99 cent.",

Two middle-aged guys, one of them (Katz!)completely out of shape in mind and body, decide to hike the Appalachian trail, from Georgia to Maine. The reader was suspect of the venture from the start, perhaps made so by the author's photo on the cover.  This is no athelete.  Full disclosure! They don't make it! They quit in Gatlinburg, TN. The author proceeds to make a series of negative comments about the area, which from this reader's personal experience are inappropriate, inaccurate and unfair.They try hiking the AT in sections, quitting again in VA, but only after Bryson takes several outrageous swipes at Confederate General Stonewall Jackson. The author is no Civil War historian (ie: Jackson and Robert E. Lee were in the Union Army at the time of the Harpers Ferry raid). The author sweeps dismissively through PA (it's a coal slag, you know), and skips NJ, NY and CT entirely. Bryson emerges in his native New England with smaller walks. Then the pathetic Katz resurfaces. They try to hike the Northern end of the AT in Maine, but surprise (!) they quit again. End of story.  I suspect strongly that Bryson backwardsly decided to write a book and then to hike the AT. Since he didn' make it, he had to use filler-lots of it. The result is a story that is satisfying in part but ultimately lacking. It would have been better if Bryson had completed a whole section of the AT, which he may have with the right partner, and stuck to writing about the outdoors. In so doing, he would have spared the good folks of Gatlinburg his &quot;humor&quot; and let Stonewall Jackson lay beneath the trees in peace.",

He writes as though he is the only one that matters in a brutal war. He has none of the qualities of the top Marine shooters who are humble, self-effacing people like Ed Kugler, Eric England, and Carlos Hathcock. I've read all of these brave mens' biographies and they come across as thoughtful, talented men, who loved the Marine Corps and did their job, but weren't glory hounds and didn't enjoy killing. Coughlin should have spared us from his ego-centric bravado.",

The guy seems to feel that the universe revolves around him and instead of showing reverence or at least respect for this american treasure that is the AT he finds most of his material from the people he encounters. Seems to me that this iowa born resident of new hampshire who has spent much of his adult life in england really doesn't care much for americans. Especially southerners. Much of the first half of this book involves his constant cracks about southern rednecks. Ok a few funny references to deliverence are acceptable but bryson doesn't stop there the cracks go on and on. Once he expressed his concern for running into \"genetically challenged\" people on the trail. Imagine if he wrote about hiking through harlem and used that term or wrote about hiking in an indian reservation and used that same term. Then bryson wouldn't be funny he would just be considered a bigot. Fact is mr bryson is an equal opportunity jerk because he doesn't like anybody. Almost everyone he encounters in this book has something wrong with them according to bryson. They are too stupid(everyone is stupid to him) too fat or speak the wrong way or drive the wrong vehicle.Now this isn't just a travel journal. Bryson tries to prove to us that he did his homework and really knows what he's talking about. Who cares. If you really want to know about hiking the appalachian trail there are hundreds of better books from people who have actually hiked the whole thing. If you want to know about the natural history of the appalachians you can also do much better. Bryson tries to tries to tie all these things together and for me it just doesn't work.",

    "reviewText": "As a scientist, I actually have an open mind regarding the two oldest standing questions that have been asked since the dawn of humanity: is there a God and is there an afterlife?I am a physicist, and the one lesson that Relativity and Quantum Mechanics show is that the universe has a much richer structure than was assumed based on Newtonian physics.  I applaud Alexander for mentioning such in his book.  For example, in his description of heaven, he notes how time is different... in essence he was \"everywhen\".  This is consistent with the view of time as the 4th dimension and a being unconstrained by the 2nd Law of thermodynamics (entropy) which imposes a linearity of \"before\" and \"after\" in our experience of time.  Freed from this, one could experience time like space:  the \"present\" would be your location in time, but you could experience also all around you the past and future.Similarly, the possible role that consciousness plays in the physical world as indicated by quantum mechanics has been recognized for over 70 years now; and without a definite resolution.  See for example Schroedinger's book, \"Mind and Matter\", or the late John Wheeler's pronouncement that the is \"is a participatory universe\"Unfortunately, Alexander falls short in terms of how the book is presented as a \"proof\";  it does not add to the above literature on the deeper structure of reality.  Here are some my objections to his case:1) His heaven is remarkably anthropomorphic. Trees, waterfalls, butterflies, and puffy clouds??  Really? A bit cliched wouldn't you say. He mentions the vastness of the universe and other beings.  So my question is, to use a science fiction example, if you were from Vulcan or Klingon, would this be your idea of heaven?2) Who gets to experience this heaven?  The apes differ from us by only a few percent and certainly process information through their neocortex and are conscious beings.  Do they get to heaven?  Anyone who lives with a dog knows they are conscious and love; the coin of the realm in Alexander's heaven.  Do they get in?  Obviously trees get into heaven, but do mosquitoes?3) I read with great interest his Appendix B.  I understand when writing for a general audience the need to limit technical details, so I expected in the appendix to find the real meat of his argument of proof.  Sadly, there is none there.  He sets up a series of straw men and then knocks them down by only two arguments: \"My experience was so rich that the physical trigger could not have worked.\" and if the trigger could have a possibility of working, then he resorts to \"My neocortex was shut down\".  He presents no hard medical evidence of his neocortex being totally non-functional.  He cites none of his actual medical tests in these arguments.  Also, the neocortex consists of billions of neurons.  None of these tests insure that every single one of these neurons were no longer firing.  I find it difficult to believe that there was absolutely zero activity yet somehow he makes a full recovery.4) There is one sentence where he mentions his past use of LSD.  LSD use results in flashbacks even years later.  Could the infections have simply caused such a flashback?  Of course, he would respond that his neocortex was shutdown, but as I mentioned before, he gives no hard evidence that this was measured in any definitive way.I was hoping for a much more technical, discussion of the NDE along with much more rigorous data.... after all that is how he is marketing the book.Finally, I would like nothing more than to believe his story.  NDE's could be another piece of data that contribute to our knowledge of the structure of reality.  This book does not do the case justice.",

However, his comment of the Earthworm's Eye View as &#34;a not entirely pleasant, but no doubt necessary, part of the cosmos&#34; doesn't begin to describe the terrors of hell and its everlasting torment.  He said he received &#34;the knowledge that  nothing can tear us from God, ever.&#34;  However, that's what hell is--an absolute separation from God.  I certainly loved that he met his &#34;angel&#34; who was his biological sister on earth ( a sister he had never met).  I understand that he was amazed at learning there is an afterlife and a God who loves him, and I rejoiced with him over that discovery.

Middle age male self-deprecation has never held much interest to me, so I found little humor in the difficulties Bryson faces due to unpreparedness and sheer sloth.Something in Bryson's ego, and perhaps lack of determination, prevented him from inviting as a companion a true nature expert...the insights and observations of a birder or botanist would have made the book a lot more immediate and informative - but perhaps such a pairing would have forced Bryson to have walked the entire trail!",

Absence of science; uniquely subjective experiences that don't jibe with others' testimony; lack of detail about the structure, mechanics, and purpose of the \"next world.\"Unlike most NDEers, Dr. Alexander gets no tunnel of light, nor life review, nor encounters with loved ones who have already crossed over. He perceives an extended flying journey over a richly colorful landscape -- something his subconscious dream factory might be likely to conjure, given his history of skydiving. Do all NDEers go to differently designed environments, or does each NDEer create his or her own?Dr. Alexander insists his physical brain could not have created his experience, but is maddeningly short of medical reasons why. He keeps saying his cerebral cortex was \"offline,\" \"shut down,\" etc. But that's pretty colloquial terminology, and at any rate most neurologists would tell you the brain delivers unexpected abilities and functions all the time.Dr. Alexander writes giddily about the huge stores of knowledge he acquired during his experience, but keeps most of it to himself. Only wisps and hints emerge. His post-recovery research is half a tour of old ground (as he discovers the 40-year-old research of Moody and Ring), half cribbed from pop summaries of quantum physics. Toward the end of the book, scientific method goes out the window. During his experience Dr. Alexander perceived a beautiful young woman flying alongside him, acting as a guide. He did not recognize her. Later he is given a photo of a deceased, previously unknown sibling, and decides that's who his guide had been -- an example of retroactive rationalization / evidence-tailoring that would shame any sophomore scientist.Despite the book's title, from a hard scientific perspective Dr. Alexander delivers no proof, any more than a UFO contactee with a vivid story to tell provides \"proof\" of UFOs. Ironically, in fact, Dr. Alexander's experience will bolster the skeptics' view that NDEs are locally manufactured hallucinations. There are many more convincing, hard-to-dismiss NDE stories to hear.",

Nevertheless, he somehow believes that his experiences support both the idea of heaven and of god.This uncritical approach to his dramatic experience is prevalent throughout the book.  For example, his one paragraph \"solution\" to the problem of free will is embarrassingly sophomoric and reflects the level of insight that he brings to the other topics in this book.I give much credit to Ptolemy Tompkins, the \"ghost author\" of this book, who turned the doctor's notes and verbal descriptions into a very readable book.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted to like this book.  The description, the award, the positive reviews all helped me decide to read it. I think I got it as a free download, as I usually don't pay for Kindle books by authors who are new to me.  I certainly did not pay more than 99 cents.  For that, I am grateful.  I also am learning not to be fooled by the 4 and 5 star reviews, since there are marketing firms who will provide glowing reviews for books as part of a paid service.  I don't like to use negative reviews either because some people just are not happy...some of the negative reviews here are from people who clearly did not read the entire book and made assumptions about the ending that were untrue.  Sadly, reviews online are somewhat undependable.  That said:The first few paragraphs alerted me to the fact that I probably would not like the book, based on the style the author used to introduce the main character.  Regardless, the subject interested me enough; I wanted to finish what I started.  (Alert: some spoilers below)The Good:1.  The best part was being surprised by the ending.  I did not see it coming. I hate figuring out the \"whodunnit\" early on.2.  I was interested enough, in spite of the bad writing, to continue and read to the end.3.  The idea for the story was good.  Any book that keeps me till the end deserves 2 stars.\\4.  It was NOT the worst book I ever read.  I don't even want a refund for my dollar or time spent reading it.  It was slightly less than OK, but  certainly not \"awful.\"The Bad:1. All of the characters were indeed one-dimensional and none of them were particularly likable.2. The dialogue between Molly and her son Erik was weird and seemed phony.3. The marriage between Molly and Cole was shallow and lame.4. There were way too many subplots that did nothing to enhance the story and only served to confuse.The Ugly:1. There are way too many psychics in this story.2. References to Hannah's ex-husband Charlie are dead ends that go nowhere. Why in the world should she be afraid of him? He left her 20+ years ago.3. How can it be possible for the pastor to hide not one, but two mentally challenged adult men in this small town without being discovered?  Where did Rodney live? How could *anyone* think keeping a mentally challenged man locked all alone in an old cellar of an abandoned old house was the humane thing to do? Furthermore, what would compel Pastor Lett to stay in such a town after such cruelty was meted out on her disabled brother?4. Why were there ghosts seen by the pastor in the Perkinson house?  What did the dollhouse have to do with anything?  This was never fully developed and was a distraction rather than an addition to the story.5. Rodney's and the Korean couple's speech was extremely annoying.6. Attempts at humor failed miserably (i.e. Edie coming to meet Molly dressed in a trench coat and sunglasses...a completey worthless scene all in all.)7. There were several plot points that should have revealed something new but merely rehashed what was already suspected or discussed.8. Who took Kate? What happened to her? Where did she come from? When did she die?9. How did Kate manage to live in the same little town undetected for all those years? How did she get food and clothing?  It is unbelievable that she could be that close to home.  This would have been more believable had she been taken far from her home and held hostage....10. At the end there is a sudden mention of \"two bodies\" which were the wife and daughter of Walter Meeks....a character I had to find using Kindle search...briefly mentioned partway through the book almost as an aside.  There was no mention (that I remembered or could find using the search feature) of finding those two bodies earlier...and it was very suddenly revealed who beat up Rodney.  The old men were arrested, but on what evidence?  Were they also suspects in killing the Meeks family?11. There are too many unanswered and unexplained points to this story.I could pick apart the entire book but this is sufficient.",

The book is nothing more than an attempt on the authors part to legitimize and validate the oldest profession in the world. It is inconceivable to me how a woman can \"fall in love\" with EVERY man that gives her some money for sexual favors. She plays the victim. How many women have been sexually assaulted, raped, and otherwise violated never resort to a \"tell all book.\" She is in fact pimping us with her nonsense throwing around a few famous names. She got PLAYED AND PAID!!!Most men do not pay for sex, then support the prostitutes they frequent.

Having read a great many accounts of the near death phenomenon, I was rather put off by his use of the title: \"Proof of Heaven.\" He offered no such thing, and now I see he has tried to escape responsibility for it. I doubt he is trying to escape from the royalties this extra bit of puffing has provided him.Without a shred of empirical evidence to give credence to his account, the fact that he is a neurosurgeon provides us with no more basis to believe than if he were a carpenter. The most logical conclusion one can make from his account is that the infection that almost killed him also caused extensive brain damage. He admits as much, and that alone could account for his visit to heaven.I did not give this a rating of one because it was quite well written. I got my money's worth. Did he do that himself?",

Says his brain wasn't functional, therefore the experience he had while comatose could not possibly have been a caused by a chemical response due to traumatic brain injury or pending brain death.  But the mere fact that his brain wasn't fatally injured meant it still had some functionality remaining; therefor it could indeed have been a brain chemical released in the process of brain injury or impending death. It wasn't dead; it revived, which proves it wasn't dead.His experience sounded a lot different from the spiritual experiences of the majority of those having near-death-experiences. It sounded much like a delusion or hallucination. The spiritual aspect of his NDE seemed lacking, and he seemed perhaps not quite as sincere as one might expect after such a profound revelation and encounter.His life sounds lovely (all those creature comforts). Maybe he experienced that earthworm/amoeba state because he had yet to learn humility. Or maybe everyone's death process is unique, and his was just customized to fit his particular consciousness.Guess we'll all find out, someday...",

After reading this book, I would believe that Americans (especially those living in the South), are inbred, stupid and have incredibly ugly towns. He is at once arrogant and narrow-minded, somehow believing that he is the only intelligent being on the planet.I liked the first half and even laughed out loud, but it became increasingly tedious (much like hiking the trail according to him- I would have liked to drop out of his narrative like he dropped off the trail)... and it's not about hiking the AT, nor is it a fair representation of America.",

Do not expect a descriptive narrative of, well, nothing in particular. Hiking etiquette? No, thanks. How he managed to write 280 pages is pretty incredible. By page 180, I was counting down the pages like my kids do with their reading homework.As some others have mentioned; the first 40 pages are very funny; then he moves into the trail and for some pages he kept my interest; but suddenly he takes a summer break. That's when the book goes from a hiking narrative to some confusing story telling. The summer day hikes are a complete disappointment (not only for you, Mr. Bryson), and finally he returns with his companion Katz for the long 10 day Maine section; but quits after 2 days.Maybe reading the well organized, emotional, and coherent \"Hiking Through\" by Paul Stutzman a week earlier set my expectations at a different level.Conclusion: glad I got it from the library.",

It did start off funny, since I am an older person and can relate to their pain, etc.  BUT I was very disapointed that they quit the trail.  I probably would not have bought the book if I had known that.  Bryson also made alot of rude remarks about Southerners and pretty much everyone he encountered, it's funny up to a point but became cruel. I get the impression he is your typical windbag elitist liberal who looks down on everyone unless they reach his intellectual or educational standards. NO THANKS! I wish I had bought this second hand so he didn't get any of my \"blue collar\" money.Since this, I have read books by AWOL, Skywalker and currently reading Becoming Odyessa-people who actually finish the AT, and I fond their stories much more entertaining and real.",

Based on the life Karrine lived and the way she reacted to certain situations informs the reader that she isn't the most intelligent woman alive, but she did have Karen Hunter aid her with this book, so between the two of them, someone should have known how to write a decent book.  However, in this instance, the poor vernacular isn't the most imperative issue here.  What truly matters here is the fact that she was so unapologetically honest about many of today's hottest male celebrities.  She was sexually involved with superstars such as Ray-J, Kool G Rap, Ja Rule, DMX, Jay Z, Shaquille O'Neal, Ice-T and Diddy.  She was seemingly honest about her liaisons with these men, many of whom are married.Karrine was able to get doors opened for her because of her good looks and amazing sexual expertise.  In this book, she makes it clear that she has no love for her mother because her mother was not there for her.  This may or may not serve as a contributing factor to why Karrine was so free with her body.  She began her \"career\" as a dancer in hip-hop music videos.  This opened doors for her; she was able to get into concerts and VIP at clubs.  In the book, Karrine doesn't necessarily glorify the finer things in life, but one can easily imply that she enjoys them a great deal.  She is very candid about her abusive relationship with rapper Kool G Rap and the fact that she was homeless.  Before the book ends, she becomes a bit preachy and lets girls know that they should want more for themselves than to be a man's whore.I truly enjoyed reading the book.  It was difficult to put down once I became engrossed into it.  If you can look past the poor writing, this book should be at least a little enjoying and/or intriguing.",

Fast Forward...When I read this book (bought it at Cosco while shopping with my sister who recommended I read it )what struck me was,\"Where have I heard/seen/experienced these same sensations or realities that makes them so familiar?\" Then I remembered my surgical experience of almost 40 years ago. After the surgery I asked my doctor about what I experienced (as it had all the components the author described) and he said they were not unusual for that drug. Does Dr. Eben's experience or my experience prove heaven exists - I don't think so - but it does prove how creative the brain is under the influence of chemicals.What I mostly noticed about this book was how well he could remember such details of everything, including what his friends, family, wife, and children all felt and experienced. Why aren't there more testimonials from physicians, nurses and others who attended to his near-death experience? I enjoy the topic so I gave it an O.K. rating, but as someone else said \"Heaven sells\" - so this was a slam dunk best seller from the gate - but how credible it is, only time will tell.",

    "reviewText": "I've read several books on NDEs. With the ambitious title *Proof* of Heaven and the quotes on Amazon from Ray Moody and Pim Van Lommel and the fact that it was written by a neurosurgeon, this book set very high expectations.  I've been around the block enough times to suspect that the use of the word \"Proof\" in the title was hyperbole, just like when I read Karen Armstrong's \"Proof\" of God.  Again, I was right.  There's no proof of anything in this book.  It it well written although short.  It's a very quick read and it drew me in right away.  There is quite a bit about Eben Alexander's life before the NDE and that is quite interesting.  Almost as fascinating as the NDE itself is the fact that he contracted the type of meningitis he did (a 1 in 10 million chance) and that he survived the type of brain trauma he experienced as a result. The fact that the guy is upright walking around and talking is a miracle. So, you could say there are three miracles that happened to him that week.As another reviewer noted, I was left wanting more of the NDE itself.  Dr. Alexander talks of great insights he received while unconscious in our world.  But, what he gives us in the book are generalities that most NDE experiencers seem to bring back. Those being that we are all greatly and unconditionally loved and there is a purpose to all of this madness.  One of the unusual things about his NDE is, while in that state, he has no recollection of Earth.  I had a friend a few years ago who had two Out of Body Experiences that sound very similar to Dr. Alexander's.  He talked of places like the Core and the Gateway (mentioned in the book) and of being in a state where he had no language, no real thoughts and was just experiencing things.  I haven't heard any other NDErs describe things that way.Overall, the book is good.  But, if you're looking for \"proof\" of heaven, I'm afraid you'll have to keep looking. I've read of other NDEs where the person experiencing them, who should have no knowledge of what is going on on Earth, has been able to describe things he could not possibly know.  There's no such proof in Dr. Alexander's experience.  Dr. Alexander tries to explain why his experience couldn't have been produced by his brain.  But, while I believe him, I don't think he proves beyond any doubt that it could not have been created as he was coming out of the coma.  We've all had dreams where seconds in that dream state seem like minutes or even days.",

Sure it had its moments, but I thought I was going to read a book about a person who walked the whole Appalacian trail and his adventures and insights.  Instead it was about an out-of-shape writer, and his more out-of-shape  friend suffering for no apparent reason, except perhaps to use as material  for a book to bring in some money.  It's no wonder they are so out of  shape, with a diet of noodles and snickers, who wouldn't be!  The first  half of the book was amusing, and somewhat funny, thanks to the antics of  the side-kick, Stephen Katz.  But once they left the trail, returned home,  and Bryson comes out for a series of day hikes, I wanted the book to end as  badly as Bryson wanted the trail to end.  I mean, the only animals they  saw were two pairs of eyes, never identified, and a moose, which was worth  mentioning, but so much talk about what they could have seen!  Also, there  is much historical and statistical data, but oddly enough, no bibliography,  just a suggested reading list.  The statistics are sometimes interesting  and often too much, just fill to make the contents of a book to sell. I  also can't understand how Bryson's family tolerated his absence, as his  approach seemed very childish.  But such walks seem to bring in the bacon  for the author.",

A Walk in the Woods chronicles the misadventures of the author, Bill Bryson and his trusty sidekick, Katz (who apparently appears in other novels of Bryson's, as well), as they embark on an epic quest to hike the entire length of the Appalachian Trail.This book has its charm, and the writing is very smart. I had a few laugh out loud moments. However, when it becomes apparent well before book's end that the author will not even attempt to reach the end of the AT, my interest started to wane. This should have been foreshadowed well before this point, but I digress.The interactions between the characters and some of those they encounter along the way were enough to get me started, but not enough to keep that fire lit. Where the book goes wrong, is it's incessant need to teach the reader copious amounts of history on points Bryson finds to be fascinating, but the reader may not. Additionally, I was disheartened to learn that both Bryson and Katz made frequent side trips by car, hitch hiked, and partook of many other modern conveniences that cheapened the reading experience.I was looking for a hilarious and interesting, possibly enlightening journey, sprinkled with adventure and comedy, and what I got was a classic bore. I would pass on this book if you're not a history buff, or if you have a short attention span.",

I'm a believer, but I've never been able to tell anyone how I just KNOW there's a God.  But hope, that's something we can all relate to, when we have it and when there's an absence of it.  For me, having a scientist agree with both faith and hope was more than uplifting.His descriptions of the medical parts resonated for me more strongly than his descriptions of his actual out-of-body experiences.  I realize that he was brave for even trying to put down in words feelings and intangibles. I'm glad he wrote this, but, as with most stories I've read about people going toward the light and the calm and the serenity that comes as the spirit departs the body, I think it's almost too specific to that one person for me to enter into it with him.What I take away is assurance that such states exist, that this scientist cared enough, believed enough to tell us about it. The book is strong and memorable for me in the layering of both faith and hope on top of his intellect and training.",

I believe he feels a very strong compulsion to share his experiences and that he put hurculean effort into recording his experiences after the fact.Whether or not he has unravelled an ancient mystery remains to be seen. Of course, when we finally discover the truth our time will have run out for sharing the news with others.My guess is that devout Christians will embrace this book and the agnostic crowd will be swayed very little if at all. The writing style and organization of the book--while admittedly not within Dr Alexander's extensive training--leaves a bit to be desired.

    "reviewText": "This book is probably the most popular book about hiking the AT, but make no mistake about it, this is a pretender's tale.For one thing the author did not hike (either thru-hike or section hike) the entire AT; he hiked about a quarter of it. To be fair, the book title did not suggest he did, and certainly you don't have to hike the entire AT to earn the right to write a book, but this leads to my second point which is: He did not even make a sincere effort to hike it. In the beginning of the book he tried to make us believe that he would thru-hike it, but it later became apparent that he did not actually intend to do so (he and his friend had other things planned out already). I think this is very misleading to say the least.Now let's forget about all this and judge the book by its own merit. The first half of the book is quite entertaining, as this was at least a pretension of trying to complete the whole trail, and there is a continuity in it. However, it also becomes apparent that the author and his friend do not actually appreciate the wilderness, they constantly curse at the daily trudging, and the author even suggests at one point that the AT should be constructed with \"hamlets\" along the way. It is also clear that the author can be quite mean-spirited at times the way he describes other hikers. But, let me be fair: if the book keeps up the consistency as in the first half, I would give it 4 stars.But then in the second half the book \"falls off the cliff\" so to speak. The author drove to various points of the AT and made some half-hearted effort to hike a few sections. This part of the book is fragmented and full of fillers (e.g. his made-up brush with hypothermia, etc.). It is actually rather pathetic. Thus, judging the book as a whole, I would give it 2.5 stars (and I am being generous to round it up to 3).",

Then God sent them to be born in the flesh on the earth. This concept is often confirmed by what God told Jeremiah, &#34;I knew you before you were born.&#34; If God did send already existing spirits to live on the earth, then He has sent millions to be condemned to Hell, because of the poor choices they make. Why would they leave a safe place in Heaven, to wind up in Hell?Of course, God knows His plan for every person that a man and woman would create, confirmed by Psalm 139, just as he knew and conceived in His mind the world before it was created.

Not an experienced backpacker, the author and his friend, Katz, heroically adjust to trail life, and in very little time fall into the backpacking routine:  walk, walk, walk, rest, eat, walk, walk, walk, eat, sleep, lather, rinse, and repeat.The author peppers his tale with interesting facts about the U.S. Forest Service, the history of the trail itself, mankind's abuses of nature, and information on various areas that he passes through.While I would have enjoyed a bit more detail at times, I was very happy with the overall content of the  book.

It is a good story, but I didn't mesh with the characters, and the dates and politics confused me since I am not familiar with Sri Lankan history at all.  The characters, especially Latha, upset me.  I know I can never understand true servitude and what it would take to wipe away years of service, but I felt like she kept to her servitude ways because she was afraid to do anything else.The reason Latha upset me so much was right away when the story opens, Latha is stealing rose colored soap because she believes she deserves it, she knew she was supposed to be in a higher position then she was born in to.  Yet when she is free (to a certain extent) she still reverts back to her role with her childhood friend/mistress Thara.  This includes sacrificing her own child and responsibilities to raise Thara's.Biso's character also grated on me because she was so cookie cutter beaten wife character.  In many books authors tend to revert to a stereotype and this is what has been done with Biso. She also makes bad decision after bad decision and was completely predictable.  I felt like I had read about Biso in numerous books under numerous names.But the book was still well written especially for a debut author and not many writers can transition from third person to first person and still pull it off.  Ru Freeman's work and stories might not be to my own liking, but for those who love betrayal, desire, Sri Lankan politics and caste systems you should like this book.  Just research the dates before you read this novel, I knew Princess Diana got married in the early 80's, but the switch back and forth caused me to loose track of the time.",

I hiked, day hikes mostly and usually as often as the weather would allow with little concern for the season.  I therefore tend to read books on AT (Appalachian Trail) and it's hikers as it's a dream I'll never realize. 'Walk' is about a man discovering there's a trail, unbroken (more or less) from Georgia to Maine. Some 2,100 miles long up the Appalachian corridor. Bryson sets off, completely unprepared mentally or physically to walk the AT and soon discovers that it's a daunting task. Bill's got a good grasp of humor and never fails to convey the humor in the situations he and his hiking companion, Katz, who's even more ill prepared for the journey than the author. There's a few moments, mostly littering by throwing gear away and not policing his cigarette butts by Katz that I find rather annoying. We also, as we sadly do in so many 'Trail' books, get preached at about just how crappy we're doing as caretakers of this planet. Bryson's not the worst by a long shot but I'd really love to read a story about hiking the AT without the need to break out into how we're killing the amphibians off or how many species of trees have gone extinct due to our careless nature. I know it's a problem but if I wanted to read about it I'd go looking for books on THAT topic and not hiking. Don't get me wrong, this is well worth reading (thanks Lisa!).

Eben claims to have seen Heaven, but I don't recall the name Jesus even mentioned in the book once, (pretty significant omission). He has named God &#34;om&#34;. He speaks of being in what he calls an &#34;earthworms eye view&#34; with faces appearing in a brown ooze. I'm sorry, but the bible says to be absent from the body is to be in the presence or the Lord. If something doesn't seem right .... it probably isn't.

The detail and authority of Alexander's medical account is at the core of Proof of Heaven, and adds immeasurably to the impact of the book.  According to Alexander, his neocortex (the area of the brain that mediates consciousness), was rendered inactive during his coma and was incapable of producing or assimilating the rich, variegated experiences that he encountered during his NDE.  Of keen interest as well is that Dr. Alexander was hooked up to monitoring equipment during his coma, and that the reported data are presumably inconsistent with the NDE that he reports.Equally of interest is Alexander's ability to evaluate the scientific theories of NDEs against his own experience.  The doctor believes that current medical theories of NDEs are inadequate to explain his experience.  Briefly, according to Alexander, current theory would explain brief, disorganized or confused  memories or thought patterns during an NDE.  Alexander reports, however, that his own NDE was lengthy, coherent and richly detailed-- a seemingly impossible medical outcome in the absence of a functioning neocortex.In an afterword to Proof of Heaven, Dr. Alexander notes that he has co-founded an organization, Eternea, to collect data on NDEs and other spiritually transformative experiences (STEs), to conduct scientific research in these areas, and to bridge the gap between scientific theory and spirituality.  This is a hopeful, constructive and immensely important endeavor.For the above reasons, I recommend Dr. Alexander's book with caveats, as discussed below.  As for the actual NDE, I found it relatively flat and impersonal, especially when contrasted to other books in this genre.  (Dr. Alexander notes that he experienced the NDE largely from a perspective of disembodied consciousness, rather than as Eben Alexander.) During his NDE, Dr. Alexander moved repeatedly between three areas:(1)An \"underworld\", characterized by a feeling of imprisonment in a primordial sludge;(2)A \"gateway area\", that would roughly conform to most human conceptions of heaven; and(3)A \"core\", an area of simultaneous darkness and illumination, which embodied a sense of advanced consciousness, all-encompassing knowledge, and a presence that many might identify as God.While Dr. Alexander's NDE is conceptually interesting (to me, it relates to the ongoing human struggle to transcend limitations, and the account roughly corresponds to religious accounts of purgatory and heaven), it was this aspect of his book that I found the weakest, owing to its somewhat impersonal flavor.CAVEATs:  Alexander's account has been investigated extensively by Esquire magazine. Esquire reports that there are a number of concerns related to Alexander's personal history and the events depicted in Proof of Heaven:1. Alexander fails to disclose multiple malpractice suits against him.  Of these, the most serious was an operation in which Alexander allegedly operated on the wrong surgical site and attempted to falsify related records to cover up his error.2. The ER doctor who treated Alexander during the coma described in Proof of Heaven denied to Esquire that Alexander lost the underlying ability to reason consciously during his coma.  The ER doctor also notes that the coma was medically induced, not spontaneous-- an important detail that is omitted from Proof of Heaven.3.  The National Weather Service, according to Esquire, partially refutes Alexander's account of the local weather conditions prevailing during and immediately after Alexander's coma.The caveats reported by Esquire do indeed diminish the credibility of Alexander's  NDE account.",

I was a little bit concerned, since when my partner handed it to me (he finished the book first) he said, \"I don't think you're going to like it...\" But still, I was really looking forward to reading it.For the first half of the book, I also really did enjoy the book. I wasn't bothered by the fact that they were unprepared or out of shape. Nobody is really prepared for their first long distance hiking trip until they are a few weeks into the trail. I remember my own experience of staggering along under my overly ambitious pack. I also enjoyed that he talked honestly about the experience of hiking, and I liked the way that he interspersed history and facts about the trail with the travel writing.The second half, however, got much less interesting. The day trips and the abortive Maine portion were actually kind of disheartening. The whole feel of the prose got sort of mean spirited. He didn't have to walk the whole trail to feel like he walked it, but I honestly would have preferred to see him expand the first half and leave the second half out completely.There is still quite a bit of good stuff in here, particularly if you are interested in the southern part of the trail. There is also quite a bit of truth about the culture of the long distance hikers. I laughed quite a bit  while I read. I guess that the complaints boiled down to not quite being as good as it could have been.",

He would readily admit the shortcomings of both he and his goofy companion but just as readily go into &quot;Deliverance&quot; jokes about every person he met on and off the trail, even taking a cheap shot at the Boyscouts! He did a fairly good job explaining the challenges of hiking the AT but had too many wanderings into political musings about the environment, the government, etc, etc, etc. Interesting read, just not great",

For example, they are either too annoying, stupid, southern, cheap, or fat to be in the good graces of Bill. Mr. Bryson comes off as arrogant, and downright rude through the book.Bill Bryson gives the illusion that he is concerned by the Forest Service and their serial road building, but doesn't take care of the woods he is walking through himself. At one point, his partner chucks a cream soda can out of his tent and it rolls into the underbrush (not to mention the food products and coffee filters that were thrown off the side of a cliff). What happened to leave no trace?I was really looking forward to reading this book, but it's not what I expected. Sure, Mr. Bryson has a few cute/comical stories, quips, and comments through the book, but it's not enough to redeem it for all other offenses. If you want to read it, check it out from the library. I will not purchase another book from this author.Note: I did purchase this item from Amazon and as always, no problems with Amazon.",

I do think, as others have commented, that too much space was used in reporting family interaction and medical detail.  I would like to have read more of his near-death experience but on the other hand it is possible that as time passes after coming out of the comma the memory details begins to fade.  On my part it is interesting to compare Dr. Alexander's vision of what happened to my studies in A Course in Miracles.

I was passionately hoping for some crumb of evidence to support what I have long believed, that there is a heaven. The hope of course being to help heal the world, but alas if you want proof of heaven you will have to look elsewhere.Oddly I found that the good doctor's experience of what Heaven is like aligned very closely with what I hope (and have logically deduced to the best of my ability) heaven will be like, and that part was quite exciting but in the end there was no proof. He does go into great detail about all the things that could have caused these experiences and walks down a checklist of why each of them do not apply but there is one glaring item he does not address \"Is it possible you were dreaming (or something closely related to dreaming) the experience either just before/after slipping into/out of the coma?\" The timeline of these experiences and how it related to real time are absent and no attempt is made to detail this aspect of his experience yet the books description leads one to believe it will do just that if only you read it's content. (This very may well be the publishers doing.)The Good Doctor even mentions the lack of a sense of time during his experiences (and we all know how skewed time can be in dreams) so I was surprised he didn't deal with this aspect. I am certain the Good Doctor believes these experiences were real but he presents no \"hard scientific proof\" and because of that I am compelled to agree with other reviewers and say that I feel more than a little bit taken advantage of by the pre-release hype the publishers spun concerning this book, I suggest changing the title.A good read but he falls short of the mark.",

    "reviewText": "This New York Times #1 bestseller is an unusual true story about life after death. It's fairly short and to the point (208 pages). I admit it seemed like a reasonable account of a near death experience (NDE) as the author comes across as very believable considering his training as a neurosurgeon. However, don't expect much in the way of exposition, theorizing, explanations, or insight about what the experience really was or what it meant. It was a personal experience that goes beyond words. It's basically a story about \"what\" happened not \"why\" it happened. Don't expect much info on \"The Other Side\". Chapters 29 (A Common Experience), 30 (Back from the Dead) and 31 (Three Camps) is the most interesting part of the book. The author dismisses the more common explanations such as REM intrusion, DMT dump, and the reboot phenomenon as \"spectacularly short\" as a workable hypothesis.There are plenty of academic, medical, scientific and other technical terms used here that seem to get in the way of a good read. That style demands to be taken seriously but can make the story plod along because the author lacks the flourish of a natural writer. Very interesting glimpse into heaven but no word of hell. I was disappointed in the title because little actual proof is offered and Heaven remains as mysterious as ever when you finish reading this book. Few answers are really provided so it is up to the reader to decide for themselves what these experiences mean. The author has a website discussing NDEs and reincarnation.",

Along with a less than able, although, willing 'friend', he recounts the variety of people, places and wonder of the eco diversity found along the trail.The most off putting of the story is his self identified political rants. Yes, the Forest Service and National Park Service have been run by idiots over time. Yes, both are still under-funded (and will continue to be). His rants detracted from the overall pleasure of his account.If you want a good account of someone's personal journey along with some great insights into the history of the development of the AT AND some of the boneheaded management decisions made in running the parks, this is a good book for it.",

    "reviewText": "Nine years ago, Molly witnessed a kidnapping, and the child was later killed. She couldn&#8217;t deal with the pain and guilt, so she and her family uprooted out to the country. Now, a 7 year old girl, Tracey, has gone missing. Meanwhile, Molly, who has psychic abilities, which she calls The Knowing, continues to have visions and feelings about the missing girl. Molly believes if she can find Tracey, she will alleviate her guilt and pain. She gets heavily involved in the case, and into some danger. The real question is, will she find her before it&#8217;s too late?In alternating chapters, we also see from Tracey&#8217;s viewpoint, who is hidden underground, with her captor, a character we know. Just as desperate as Molly is to find her, we are desperate to find out why she was stolen and why her captor believes it was justifiable.I really love reading books about missing people, kidnappings, and disappearances. One of my favorites in this category is The Year of Fog by Michelle Richmond. Although it is a very sad topic, it is fascinating too and I find myself captivated by these kinds of stories. Chasing Amanda was an interesting story about kidnapping, made even more interesting by the fact that we see Tracey, the abducted child, and hear her point of view while she is missing. I&#8217;ve rarely come across missing persons stories like this, and really thought this was a cool concept, rather than having the abduction shrouded in complete mystery&#8230; but don&#8217;t be mistaken! There still is plenty of mystery surrounding it, in that we know who kidnapped her, but are left wondering why they did it. The kidnapper states repeatedly that they saved Tracey, and were doing what they had to do. Since we knew where Tracey was, I wasn&#8217;t on the edge of my seat with the suspense, but I still really enjoyed it. I also liked the psychic visions that Molly had, giving the book a touch of the supernatural but in a very realistic setting.The story is quite interesting and I think it could be even better with some excellent editing. On numerous occasions, I would come across a sentence that really should have been two, as there were two different statements separated only by a comma (Example: &#8220;Molly put on her jogging clothes, the familiarity of them felt like an old friend&#8230;&#8221; p. 201). Because I am a stickler for grammar, this detracted slightly from my reading experience, but I don&#8217;t think it would bother everyone.",

    "reviewText": "As all reviews should start, I read this book as a Christian and with 37 years of working in a medical related field.  So, I'll review it first as a Christian. This NDE (near death experience) that Alexander had is indeed hard to quantify. I would never say he made it up or that he didn't somehow experience the things he writes about. But, did he go to heaven - absolutely not. For one thing, there is no accounting for the atonement of Christ on which every Christian's faith rests. Instead, he seems to imply (or perhaps I only inferred)that there is sufficient \"love\" to get everyone to heaven. Had Alexander not been clinically brain dead for seven days and if I had only read his out-of-body experiences I would have sworn he was on an LSD trip as the phenomena is sounds very similar. I found his \"proof\" in the back of the book that it was not a medical cause curious as he continually stresses that the cause of his \"death\" is one in a million that 90%+ die from it. Therefore, I would think that the premise of the book falls short in that he has no valid or solid conclusion about the NDE.From a medical standpoint, the book is very entertaining although you need a modicum of medical and scientific knowledge to understand all that he writes. One of the strongest areas of learning in the book is the value of having family sit at your bedside constantly if you are in an ICU/CCU. This is important to the patient as it is well-known that holding the patient's hand and talking to them regularly increases survival rate. It also helps prevent negative talk in front of the patient (which they hear even in coma) and screwups by the doctors and nurses.  I think his strongest statement in the book concerns scientific and medical studies, which complains about the success of placebo's healing rate at 30% because it screws up the study conclusions instead of studying the placebo effect to see if they can increase it. Good advice, but I don't know if the government will finance these kinds of study?",

    "reviewText": "Eben Alexander is a neurosurgeon. In 2008 he contracted a rare illness that struck with unusual rapidity and put him into a coma hours after it struck. He remained in that coma, unable to even breathe for himself, for seven days. His doctors considered him brain dead and unable to wake up; or, if by some miracle he did wake up, he would be severely brain damaged. But he did wake up, and within a short time regained all his abilities. How did this happen?While the pathogen causing Dr. Alexander&#8217;s illness was discovered- it was the common E. coli- they never did figure out how it managed to get into his brain and spinal cord fluid. Nor did they figure out how he survived it when his neocortex was shut down for days- or how he felt himself to be conscious through out the seven days and had memories of being in heaven during that time. He is convinced that his survival and his memories of heaven are proof that God exists, that the soul exists after death, and that his survival was a miracle. There is also the fact that he knew a couple of things that went on while he was in a coma that he shouldn&#8217;t have been able to know. He states that God loves us all, and his illness was for a reason.I&#8217;m not automatically against the possible reality of near death experiences &#8211; NDEs- but I don&#8217;t automatically believe them, either. Alexander&#8217;s recovery from his illness was unlikely but there are other cases of people recovering from illness that should have killed them. And we certainly don&#8217;t know everything about the brain; neuroscience learns surprising things every day. What happened to the author was remarkable and some aspects are unexplainable at this time, but there is a chance his interpretation is colored by his religious training.Then there is the problem that some of the things in his book just aren&#8217;t true; he took some liberties with the truth here and there. Alexander did not lapse into a coma on his own; because he was delirious and thrashing around to the point he couldn&#8217;t be treated, the emergency room doctor put him into a medically induced coma which necessitated putting him on a ventilator. He was kept in that coma, and the doctors periodically tried to bring him out of it, only to find him still delirious; he was never &#8216;brain dead&#8217;. He states that as he was about to be transferred from the emergency room to the ICU, the rallied for a moment and shouted &#8220;God help me!&#8221;, but the emergency room doctor, a friend and co-worker of the author, says that is impossible because he was already intubated, and with that hose down your throat, you can&#8217;t speak. There are a few other examples of dramatic license here and there, but most of them aren&#8217;t serious. Do these lapses of verity invalidate the author&#8217;s message? I don&#8217;t know.Was the author&#8217;s recovery near miraculous? Pretty much. Does his NDE prove life after death? No. Does the fact that he apparently had mental contact with other people, learning things he couldn&#8217;t have known prove that *something* science can&#8217;t explain yet happened? Possibly; but because I now cannot trust his version of events, I don&#8217;t know. I wish he&#8217;d put forth the true version of events rather than try and make them more dramatic; his story would have been a lot more convincing then.",

I think anyone interested in afterlife studies would benefit from reading it, as would some skeptics and scientific types. But if you're distracted by poor structure and things like run-on sentences, you may have a hard time getting through this book. Dr. A, understandably, is much more fascinated by the complex workings of the neurocortex than the typical reader would be. Long passages about brain function are interwoven with tales of his other-wordly and family experiences in a way that's a bit awkward. I hope he'll consider using a ghost writer in subsequent editions. Still, the story is fascinating enough and the price low enough to give it a read.",

In an effort to try to save her life and marriage, she moved her family to the small town of Boyds. Everything seems to be getting better until a little girl goes missing. Molly feels compelled to help find her, even if it means destroying the peace she has finally found. Can she find Tracey before she loses everything she loves?I enjoyed the storyline, but didn't like Molly. I found her selfish, unrealistic and just plain annoying. I have tried to figure out why I disliked her so much, but I can't pinpoint any one thing. In the first few chapters, I found myself sympathizing and siding with her husband more than her, and I just never got over that.Since Molly's character is such a big focus in the book, I found it hard to get into the rest of the story. I did find myself interested in how the kidnapper was. There were hints here and there, and I did figure it out about halfway through the book. This didn't detract from the story as I was still trying to figure out more of the back story.Overall, this was an interesting storyline with lots of secrets to be revealed. I really wanted to love the book, but I couldn't connect with, or even like, the main character, which definitely affected my opinion. This is a book I would recommend as I am sure I am in the minority regarding Molly.",

Laymon, more than any other horror author, has sort of a 'learning curve' to get through to be enjoyed. I think that Blood Games is a much better introductory novel of his to read than the Beast House stuff.The characters are believable archetypes and serve the novel very well even if they're not particularly original. There's a zany filmmaker, a model, a regular girl, and so on. With five main people in the novel of the same sex, sometimes it's hard to distinguish, and Blood Games suffers from that at times. Overall, though, it seems to work. The sense of foreboding that dominates the bookBlood Games is a fairly well-written horror novel and, though it moves along particularly slowly in parts, definitely is worth a shot. Laymon has a unique style - very 80s pop horror, a la King and Koontz - and the formulas he uses work sometimes and don't work in others.As with Midnight Tour, though, there are definitely some problems with the novel. The flashbacks are almost wholly unnecessary and serve only to characterize all of the women. But, by the time you get through the second flashback, you have a good idea of who's who and ultimately feel yourself skimming them. I certainly did.",

    "reviewText": "While I have to disagree with the title Proof of Heaven that this book was actually not proof of heaven, I found the premise and the experience shared in this book quite fascinating. Dr. Alexander talks about his experiences while in a coma from a serious bacterial meningitis attack that is quite rare and shuts down the neo-cortex of the brain, the part that makes us, basically, human, and puts him in a coma he was not expected to live through or return from. He shares his vivid memories of experiences he had in a place outside of this realm of existence, memories of acceptance, love, inclusiveness, connectedness, peace, calm and so many good things. The main point that of love, unconditional and overwhelming, in a way that isn't even able to be expressed on this world.Dr. Alexander considers this absolute proof of God and Heaven, where I see it as proof that there is something after this life, but not necessarily the religious versions of God and Heaven as we have been told in the Bible or through other religious upbringings. I find the concept of unconditional love fascinating, and somewhat comforting, and I definitely like the perspective of life of some sort, existence and consciousness of some sort, after this body fades away, especially now that I have been diagnosed with a terminal illness, and thinking about death and dying is something that has come to my mind sooner than it would for most people.I enjoyed his personal stories about his journey. I appreciated his honesty about how he was not really a believer prior to this experience, that he was a staunch man of science, to a point, and how this changed that. I like the way he now weaves these two things--the science and the faith--together to be a better doctor and a better person.I like that he provides other resources and information for the reader to read, to consider, and to decide for themselves what they think happened. I went to many of his other resources and read them and even saw him in some video where he was interviewed about his experiences. It's all very compelling... and again, somewhat comforting, especially to me. See, I have a terminal illness, and I know my death is more imminent than I had original expected it to be... life and death, this life and the afterlife, have both been big on my mind. This book did provide me some comfort, some feeling that there might be something else out there beyond this. I think I needed that. At the same time, there was some compelling stories that tied some things in his life together in a way that seems only able to happen outside of this realm. You'll have to read his story to learn more about it. If you're interested, but not sure about buying the book, look him up online and read some of the places where he talks about near death experiences with others who have had them too. Fascinating stuff, and it might help you make up your mind if this is something you want to consider buying or not. I consider it money well spent, if for nothing but the fascination factor.If you're not a believer, this book might make you think about an afterlife differently. If you are a believer, I think this book can really reenforce your faith. If you're a skeptic, you might still find this book fascinating in what it shares about how to live your life now. I think it's well worth considering and picking this one up to read, and he tells the story in a compelling way. There is enough technical and medical/scientific information to make you feel informed, but not so much it's bogged down. And there is enough personal anecdote and experience to feel you're reading a story too. Good balance.",

Miles has a gift for convincing language that never strays out of its period, and she packs the book full of historical events that fans of the Elizabethan era will no doubt relish. I enjoyed some of her assumptions and conclusions about the rationale for Elizabeth's actions, although I'd have to say that the very best of these wasn't revealed until the epilogue and was almost an afterthought, while it could have been the thesis for the story. Perhaps it WAS the thesis and I just didn't catch the hints along the way - regardless, it was terribly clever.There were times when this book was difficult to put down, but the pace ebbed and flowed, unlike Gregory's books, which drive forward with relentless page-turning fury. Still, you can't put your life on hold to read all the time, and this is an excellent and enjoyable choice for picking away at in stolen moments here and there.",

Most of all I like hearing about Lt. Col McCoy who seems like a brave commanding officer who deeply cares about his marines.  The book is extremely informative about the inner workings and tactics of marine snipers in today's Marine Corps.  In many ways the book is a fast paced read because the demand for the snipers to move quickly on the battlefield.I wish the author would have delved more into his family situation, but he decided not to tell that part of the story.  I hate when women say \"we need to talk,\" those words are a real drag.  I guess one drawback would be there is no real dramatic ending or climax but I imagine that helps display some of the mundane of conflict and the accuracy of the account.  Officer Bob sounds like a tool, and even if that aspect is embilished a little bit, it helpfully points to some of the frustrations of combat.  The author should have added a little more concerning his entire career as a U.S. Marine.  The book is overall an easy and interesting read however.  And while this is not one of the best accounts from the conflict in Iraq it is a valuable account and worthy of reading.  God Bless the U.S. Marines and keep up the good and heroic work in Iraq.",

    "reviewText": "A gripping novel that will keep you in your seat reading until the whee hours because you MUST find out how it will all unfold. A story of 3 lost girls and the woman who has visions as to their whereabouts and how they ended up stolen from their families. A suspenseful book with just a hint of some paranormal twists. I definitely had a hard time putting this one down when it was beyond my bed time! There were a few slow spots that I would have speed up a bit and a lot of searching in the woods for the little girl, but as a whole this book sped along like a train.I think the one thing that I absolutely loved was the description of the characters and places. I could really picture each character and feel their personalities - they became lifelike. The setting - Boyds, MD was unqiue and described with such detail that I felt as though I could picture it right in front of me. A distinct city with a rural setting that allowed for certain events to occur that could never have happened anywhere else.As with every suspense, I rate a book as to how far in advance I find out who dun it or if they are in the story at all. I think I realized the captor at the best moment, because I spent the rest of the book trying to confirm my hunches. A perfect amount of hints were given along the way, but nothing too blatant.A suspenseful book that is definitely worth the grab. A book for both genders and most ages to read whether it be in the middle of summer or curled up in the winter.",

    "reviewText": "This is the second Bill Bryson book I have read (\"Notes From a Small Island\" was the other) so I knew I was guaranteed much wry and spot-on humour, together with eccentric experiences and out-of-the-usual travel reminiscing. He did not fail to live up to these expectations. He is so adept at making you feel like you live in the moment with him as he encounters both the banal and the sublime. This book truly treasures the Appalachian Trail, while not hiding its frustrations and mundaneness. There is also much in the way of interesting factual information which serves as a compelling case for environmental advocacy. I am certain most who treasure the environment will find much to cheer about, and much to rue, in this book, as I did.Early on, Bryson forgoes any perfectionistic desire to complete his hike of the whole trail and instead is content to hike part of it, and in so doing, shows us both its mysteries and challenges together with its beauty. It also takes some of the pressure off him and us, as he is content to enjoy the walk rather than try and accomplish something for its own sake.He has written a very entertaining story which does service to both the environment in America and the gift of human companionship, walking the shrinking Appalachian woods with his hilarious hiking buddy, Katz. American culture is always an easy target for a skilled humourist and Bryson is good at poking fun where it is due, and pointing out the sad lack of appreciation for natural beauty among much of the American public.The end result of reading this book, as I am sure it has been for many others, is that it fed my desire to explore more of the outdoors, appreciate what we have and fight to keep it.",

    "reviewText": "Bill Bryson is a funny guy.  I'd love to have his job, which apparently is, as a \"travel journalist\", to take vacations and write about them.  He does do a fair amount of research too, and he shares that throughout the book.  But while this book will share some interesting tidbits about the Appalachian Trail, it is not primarily about the AT, but more about his and his buddy's trip on it.  They have some comical adventures.  They obviously aren't experienced hikers, but did seem to fare better than some people on the trail.  In any event, I would recommend this book.  It is a short read - about 225 pages, and reads very quickly.  I gained an appreciation for the AT, which I knew very little about.  I also had some laugh-out-loud moments reading this book.  In short, it is a pleasant, none-too-serious true life tale that will garner a few laughs along the way.I think Bill Bryson's book, \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" is better than this one - as there is quite a bit more meaty information in it.  However, the two books are quite different styles.  This one is kind of a diary/travelogue, while \"A Short History of Nearly Everything\" is a short history of science and its characters.  Bryson doesn't play nearly as prominent a role in \"A Short History\".  Different books, but both quite good.",

It isn't without its flaws, but still it's a delightful book.It might be paradoxical to say so, but maybe because it's so honest that one feels at first slightly disappointed in the book.  This isn't a story about hiking the Appalachian Trail (AT) end-to-end.  Bryson and his hiking companion, Katz, early on think that maybe they'd try to complete the AT, and the reader gears up for it, too, but it becomes clear by halfway through the book that that's not going to happen--if only because the reader sees the pages dwindling away and miles of trail still stretching out far ahead.  The book loses its footing a bit when Bryson and Katz split up.  Up to that point, the reader has been following the preparations for the trip, tagging along on Bryson and Katz's hike on the AT from Georgia to Virginia, and occasionally taking a break to listen to Bryson's ruminations on the history of the AT and the changing environment through which it passes.  Much of the narrative is laugh-out-loud fun.  Bryson's writing honors the tradition of Mark Twain's humorous commentary on the American scene.After Bryson and Katz part ways, Bryson just samples the Trail from Pennsylvania through New Hampshire.  Here Bryson's narrative is soberer, and focuses less on his experience than on anecdotal history.  The fire and ice vignettes--from the burning ghost town of Centralia, Pennsylvania to the freezing winds of Mount Washington--are not without interest.  When Bryson himself enters the scene, though, he's cranky (except when he revels in not carrying his pack), judgmental, and has a tendency towards easy generalizations (this is seen in passages about the South, too).  You get a flash of Bryson's humor now and then, like the anecdote about the directionally challenged Chicken John, but it's not the same as before.  You just want Katz to come back.And he does.  Katz rejoins Bryson to hike the uber-challenging Hundred Mile Wilderness in Maine.  Katz and Bryson, in very different ways, save each other's life in these pages, and you realize, perhaps belatedly, that this book, which only rarely looks up to appreciate the natural surroundings through which it passes, isn't really about the Appalachian Trail, it's about being and staying alive.The book didn't inspire me to be a \"through-hiker\" on the AT, but it did get me to think about doing some day hiking.  And it also made me think that I'd like to read another Bryson book.",

First, and most important in my view, is that the author presents detailed medical facts about his condition prior to what he asserts was his physical death. He presents convincing evidence that his brain was completely dead and displayed no electrical activity whatsoever. Second, he is absolutely certain that he was indeed dead and his account of his experience includes a great deal of detail that I have never seen in the memoirs of others -- and I have read scores of books on this topic. Finally, unlike many other people who have undergone post- or near-death experiences, Dr. Alexander's medical training and understanding of the human brain makes him a highly credible judge of what actually happened to him. I am not implying that others are not credible; only that this particular author has a degree of knowledge that most others lack and therefore he has more information on which to base his analysis.Whatever you choose to believe, it is quite clear that this doctor experienced some highly unusual phenomena, not just because he claims to have seen 'heaven' but because he was brain dead and then, rather suddenly, revived *with all of his mental functions intact.* Several physicians who attended him are quoted in the book as saying they have no idea how someone in his condition could regain 100% function, but he definitely did. And he has been subjected to entire batteries of medical tests in an effort to ascertain just how his body was able to do this -- all to no avail. Some might call it a miracle. Overall, Dr. Alexander's story is absorbing and a worthwhile read.One more thing to the credit of this book is that it has an excellent bibliography from which interested readers can identify other books on this and similar topics. For me, the question of life after death was not resolved by reading this book, but it did go a good way toward opening up new avenues of inquiry and presenting some ideas that I had not previously considered.",

    "reviewText": "(1) This book clearly shows the obvious that only when you yourself have an \"extraordinary experience,\" you, even if you have been a diehard materialist, become a believer of \"extraordinary facts\" which almost always lack \"extraordinary evidences.\"(2) There are numerous examples of NDE (near death experience), as the author has studied previous examples after his own NDE experience. Unfortunately, these experiences are intrinsically of \"Subjective\" nature, and hence, as we have seen, are always rejected by \"Objective\" science, despite the author's explanation based on the \"Objective\" recordings of his brain activity during his coma of almost one week.(3) If, however, NDE were accepted as a scientific fact, then it would mean that science accepts some version of the so-called notorious \"Dualism\" initiated by Descartes. John R. Searle, Professor of philosophy at the UCB, writes in his book The Mystery of Consciousness (1997) as follows to reject any versions of \"dualism\":... But dualism seems out of the question. To accept dualism is to deny the scientific worldview that we have painfully achieved over the past several centuries. To accept dualism is to conclude that we really live in two quite different worlds, a mental and a physical world, or at the very least that there are two different kinds of properties, mental and physical. ... (pp. 194-195).(4) Recently I read the book \"Quantum Enigma - Physics encounters consciousness\" by the physicists Bruce Rosenblum & Fred Kuttner (2012/ 2nd Ed.). I posted my critical review of the book, in which I wrote (& also copied the following in my review of Searle's book):\"In my view I am very much sure that a form of dualism would be verified sooner or later in some \"physical experiments.\" I speculated it in a paper published in the Journal of Scientific Exploration, Vol. 24, No.1, pp. 5 - 39, 2010: Rebuttal to claimed refutations of Duncan MacDougall's experiment on human weight change at the moment of death,\" (which is available from amazon.com).(5) In my view, some \"Objective\" physics experiments should be conducted to show that our physical dimension is not a closed system but open to some non-physical dimensions, regardless of their being called a \"Heaven\" or a world for Afterlife &c.; And this is what I speculated in the paper mentioned in (4). And this kind of physics experiments definitely helps in judging whether or not the author's claim is correct.",

I loved his book on Australia because I am Australian, his books on small-town America because I have lived in small-town America, and his books on England and Europe because I have travelled extensively throughout both.

    "reviewText": "Bryson's book is entertaining as well as full of interesting facts and opinions. He rails against the Park Service for not protecting the wilderness areas and its animal and plant inhabitants. He spends a lot of time discussing the dangers of long distance hiking through Appalachia; bears, wild cats, murderers, hypothermia, starvation....Yet he never really has any serious problems and the only large wild animal he encounters is a moose.He paints a funny yet disturbing picture of Americans in general, their addiction to cars, their lack of curiosity, and lack of education. He encounters and critiques drunk hillbillies, ditzy yuppie hikers, technology and equipment obsessed bores, and an occasional well prepared hiker who he appreciates. Bryson has a somewhat sarcastic attitude, is a bit of a snob, with an aquired English writing style; he uses words like \"arresting\" instead of attractive and says \"flush for food\" instead of well stocked. But this is also his charm and wit, so I can ride with it.  Meanwhile, Bryson and especially his friend Katz have a complete lack of culinary abilities, surviving for much of the trip on noodles (Ramen?) Snicker bars and Slim Jims.  Oatmeal would have been a perfect trail food and a much better alternative to Snicker bars and Slim Jims.  Bryson failed to bring the oatmeal that Katz had purchased because he didn't like it.  I am really surprised at least one of them didn't die from appendicitis along the trial. Or, dead or dilimbed from a bear attack.  Bryson states in the beginning that bears are attracted to Snicker bars, yet he carries a hugh load of them.Bryson nostalgically refers back to his times in Europe on a number of occasions. He obviously prefers the well groomed and tavern/hotel lined hiking routes of Europe over the crude outback of America. However, at one point he states that if the AT were lined with nice facilities, the expense would make walking the AT prohibitively expensive, so he concedes that it isn't practical.I was disturbed by Katz's proclivity for tossing good food and expensive clothes out of pack in an attempt to reduce the weight.  At one point he even tossed his water bottle.  This seemed purely moronic.  And a waste of money, even as Bryson complained about the cost of food and motels along the way.  Why they couldn't share a room was another odd thing I didn't understand.At the end, I felt at once concerned about the fate Katz and not too concerned about Bryson's fate. Katz was slipping into alcoholism at the end of the book and  Bryson was arguably not doing much to halt that slide.  Katz is a needy yet sensitive guy and Bryson is satirical and a bit of a hardass. Bryson's habit of walking way ahead of Katz was disturbing and I thought a dangerous practice in those wild areas and probably added to Katz's feelings of alienation and abandonment.  I hope Katz finds his way. Bryson no doubt is living in some well manacured English town hanging out at pubs and spinning yarns about his travels.Dispite all my complaints about his attitudes and contradictions, I think Bryson is a great writer, funny, informing, and perceptive.  As a west-coaster with little knowledge of the area, I learned a lot about the Trail and its history.  If I ever go hiking on the AT, I'll know what to expect (this statement is to all those hikers who, as related in the book, after four hours quit the trail because \"It wasn't what I expected.\")",

    "reviewText": "Returning to the US after living in England for twenty years, Bill Bryson becomes intrigued with the idea of the hiking the Appalachian Trail, a portion of which is in his New Hampshire backyard.  The 2100-mile trail from Georgia to Mt. Katahdin in Maine winds through virgin forest and scenes of incredible natural beauty and provide an unparalleled opportunity to be alone and reflective.Bryson's sense of adventure and his enthusiasm hold him in good stead as he sets off in Georgia, though he has little idea of how difficult it will be to hike 15 or more miles a day, up and down mountains with forty pounds of gear, including a tent, on his back.  He is accompanied by Stephen Katz, an acquaintance from Iowa with whom he once traveled in Europe, who is even more out of shape than he is.  The contrast between the attitudes of the two men--Bryson, enthusiastic, and Katz, grimly concerned (and complaining) about the difficulties--reflect, between them, the attitudes of virtually any reader of this amusing and thoughtful travelogue.  Additional kooky characters appear throughout this account to add humor and complexity to the hike.Bryson is a fine observer of nature, and as he and Katz travel for six weeks from Georgia through the Carolinas into the Shenandoah National Park, he includes much background about the trail and its history, and about the record of the National Forest Service and the National Parks Service, both of which he finds shocking.  The National Forest Service is the largest builder of highways in the country, providing access for logging operations in the forests.  The National Parks Service has a hands-off policy regarding the protection of endangered species of trees, which are dying due to global warming, diseases, and pollution.At the end of six weeks, Bryson and Katz end the first phase of the hike and return to their homes.  The book loses some of its narrative momentum and its humor when Bryson returns months later to continue part of the trail alone--the reader misses Katz and his complaints--and Bryson becomes more philosophical and more critical of governmental policy in the latter part of the book.  Overall, however, this is a fascinating account of a trail that traverses a major part of the eastern landscape, and Bryson beautifully conveys his awe for its magnificent scenery.  To the extent that its species are vanishing and its forests are dying, it is also a wake-up call to all concerned Americans.  n  Mary Whipple",

    "reviewText": "This book recounts the adventures of Bill Bryson as he attempts to hike the Appalachian Trail.  Not long after returning from a twenty-year stint as a journalist in England, Bryson became fascinated with the idea of hiking the Appalachian Trail, portions of which practically ran run through his backyard in Hanover, New Hampshire.  After announcing to his friends and publisher that he was planning to hike the trail, Bryson then had to go through with it and actually do some hiking.  As it turned out, he didn't have to hike alone, since one of his friends, on learning that Bryson was going to tackle the trail, volunteered to accompany him.  This friend, Stephen Katz, had hiked with Bryson before, but was in even worse physical condition than Bryson himself, being still in recovery from drug and alcohol rehab.It was a chilly day in March when Bryson and Katz set out on the trail-head in Georgia.  Over the next few months, they encounter hikers and wildlife, see breathtaking vistas and countless trees, and trudge several million steps together.  They learn the vagaries of their equipment and the etiquette of the Trail, and make peace with the past.  Along the way, Bryson takes time out to describe some of the scientific thrills observable from the Trail, and he occasionally rails against the hazards that are degrading the environment.What is odd for a book of this kind is that Bryson seems to have a distinct dislike for wilderness, despite his enthusiasm for hiking.  It's hard to tell if he is exaggerating for the sake of humor or if he is truly as terrified of wild critters as he makes out to be.  Thinking back, he remarks that hiking in Luxembourg, where he could stay in inns each night and was never far from civilization, was much more fun.  And when he and Katz head for the part of the AT that is most deep in the wilderness, that's when things nearly far apart for them.  This distaste for the very wilderness that is at the heart of the AT experience may set some readers off,  but other than that, the book is a very entertaining account of a spring and summer well-spent.",

    "reviewText": "I am a fan of coming-of-age tales (The Kite Runner) and family sagas (The House of the Spirits) as well as stories that are told with multiple voices (The Poisonwood Bible).  I am especially fond of stories that take me to other places, places I've never been but have always been curious about (Memoirs of a Geisha, Snow Flower and the Secret Fan).  So when I came upon \"A Disobedient Girl\" through the Vine program, I found a story that really fit the bill.Author and political journalist Ru Freeman tells two stories at once in her debut novel, one of a girl named Latha who is a servant in a prosperous Colombo home and the other of a woman named Biso who is running away from a sullied reputation as well as an abusive alcoholic husband.  Though Latha outwardly adheres to the Sri Lankan caste system, she rebels in small ways by pilfering luxurious soap from the Vithanage's lavatory and developing a sisterly bond with Thara, the daughter of the household who is of the same age.  A little too willful for her own good, Latha's rebellion ends up getting her into trouble early on; when she is denied her wages to buy a new pair of sandals, she exacts revenge on the surly mistress of the house through Thara's girlhood crush Ajith and winds up pregnant at 16.  Sent to a convent to have the baby, she returns to Colombo for Thara's wedding and is shocked to learn that not only is she marrying their other childhood friend Gehan (a boy for whom Latha had affection) but has also been commissioned by Thara to be a servant in her new home, an ironic and cruel penance for her past sins.  Between Latha's tribulations is Biso's great escape from a miserable life, she and her three young children stealing away in the early morning hours from the seaside town of Matara to her aunt's house in Ohiya, a journey they take by train.  Biso encounters setbacks, prejudice, tragedy and terrorism along the way and reminisces on her brief but bold affair with a man named Siri, a rebel rouser who fathered her youngest child.  Though the journey is long and their resources limited, Biso keeps a brave face for her children, knowing all too well that though the gods seem to be smiling on them at every turn, their good fortune will only last so long.Freeman alternates viewpoints chapter by chapter, Biso's tale told in first-person and spanning only a few days, Latha's in third and spanning several years (an interesting juxtaposition of narratives). The novel is so saturated in Sri Lankan culture and Sinhalese terminology (phonetically spelled, making it impossible to translate for someone who does not know how to speak or write Sinhala) that it can often distract from the story and becomes a detriment to its readability.  She uses one too many Sinhalese words in her character's dialogue, leaving a reader wondering what someone has said (Have they used an expletive? An endearment? A proper noun to denote class? No one knows half the time).  She also frequently mentions obscure brand names (Baygon, Panatol, Disprin, etc.) and forget about interpreting any slang - it's a lost cause.It appears Freeman was a little ignorant in estimating the worldliness of her readership, unmindful that the majority of people who pick this up will more than likely NOT be of South Asian descent and/or origin and won't know much about it as a result.  Or perhaps she thought she was educating her readers, only to end up confusing them instead.  This is where the editor and/or publisher should've made some smart cuts and amendments to help simplify, clarify and balance the book's contents before it hit the shelves (it did so only two weeks ago).  Though these details may encourage some (such as myself) to scour the internet and other resources to find out more about Sri Lankan culture, it may vex others beyond repair and nearly 400 pages of it is a lot to digest.Other than this most glaring of flaws, Freeman writes with a passion and intensity that propels the emotional viewpoint of her characters, seamlessly blending past with present.  She deftly interlaces her characters' fates with small and subtle threads to weave a brilliant tapestry of fate, perseverance, love, betrayal, integrity, the bonds of family and sisterhood and the suffering that results from the choices we make.Bottom line: Emotional, tragic and beautiful, \"A Disobedient Girl\" will open a reader's eyes to another world, another culture, another way of life, providing a sumptuous and heavyhearted tale amidst the exotic backdrop of a country isolated from its neighbors by the yawning depths of the Indian Ocean.  If you're a fan of Khaled Hosseini's \"A Thousand Splendid Suns\", this one comes highly recommended.",

    "reviewText": "This is a slightly different Laymon book.  While it has many of the standard elements they are weighted differently in this one.Five young women met as freshmen in college.  Although all quite different, circumstances of their initial meeting bonded them together.  One thing they all had in common was they did not like injustice and wrong-doing (particularly when aimed at one of themselves).  During college they have a number of wild adventures where they dole out their own brand of justice.  These stories are portrayed as flashbacks throughout the book.Just after graduation they decide to get together once a year for new adventures.  Each year a different one chooses where they will go and what they will do.  This time Helen, a fan of horror movies, has chosen an abandoned hunting lodge where a slaughter took place many year earlier.  But things quickly turn serious when they realize that the place is not completely abandoned.  But it is when they decide to cut their visit short and leave the first day that things begin to go wrong. Now the ladies must pull together and use their skills in their most serious adventure.Unlike many other Laymon books, we do not see characters become uncontrolled when the bonds of civilization are broken.  This book really focuses on characters standing up for themselves and taking the law into their own hands.  Also unlike many others, this one offers better explanations as to why the characters make the decisions they do and why the police are not an option.  Definitely chilling in parts with great atmosphere.  Things really do proceed right to the final page.  A must for Laymon fans.PS.  Look for the author's cameo.",

    "reviewText": "I listened to this book as an audio book, so my experience of it may be different than that of other readers.The actor, not Bill Bryson, who read this book did an excellent job. His voice was interesting and pronunciation of words sounded good. I give him 5/5 stars.I really enjoyed listening to this book, but the first half of the book was much more interesting and engaging than the second half. I am not a hiker by any means, but recently my husband and my parents talked about trying a few days on the Appalachian Trail just to see what it's like. Therefore, I went to the library and got all of the books I could find about the trail and thought this might be a fun book to listen to.As others have pointed out in reviews, the first half of the book is great. Bryson and his friend Katz are on the trail, living and learning about themselves and the great outdoors. When they left the trail and subsequently decided to skip some sections, I thought, \"Alright, that's fine, I'm sure there's only so many interesting things one can say about walking through this section of trail. We'll see what happens in the next state.\" Then, after they had been on the trail for (I can't remember how long) a couple of months, they left because they had to get back to their lives. Again, I understand. This was taking longer than expected, I'm not sure that they were fully prepared (or as prepared as one can be) for such an expedition, ok, the end. However, that was not the end of the book; I still had 4-5 more CDs to go!After they left the trail, Bryson still felt the urge to hike. He took day trips closer to his home in Connecticut and climbed some of the more mountainous areas. But, of those excursions, none of them had the same feel, for him or in his writing, as when he was solidly on the AT. Also, he seemed to be becoming more and more frustrated with the National Parks system and people along the way.Throughout the book, Bryson is quite amusing with his side stories from the hike about himself, Katz, and some of the people they met along the way. Also, the information he gives about the trail and how it came to be, in the first half of the book was quite interesting.I still want to try to hike some of the trail. I don't think the entire AT is for me, but listening to his experience makes me want to try parts of it for a few days or weeks at a time.",

    "reviewText": "This audio book was written and read by the author is in the style of John McPhee and even quoting him once in a while. It includes facts and people like \"The Perfect Storm.\"  Then Bill Bryson adds first hand personal experiences. You can identify with his comments that do not have to be funny to be familiar.This book recounts Bill Bryson's experiences on the Appalachian Trail. The dry facts can be picked up through other material. However the personal experiences are just that, personal. If you have never been hiking then you still get a feel for what you have missed. However if you have hiked then you can really appreciate the people he met, and circumstances that he went through. There are hikers and then there are hikers. In the Boy Scouts you are usually in a well-organized group, in the military you have to be more cautious of objects and terrain, Sierra Club and Outward Bound have their unique points of view. So if his experience is different, it still makes for fun reading.I even liked the sections on selecting and using the equipment. I am afraid if I had met Bill Bryson on the trail; I would have been one of those \"equipment comparing\" people.Anyway do not expect an epic and you will enjoy the time you spend reading this book. Oh, and it does make me want to go hiking.The Mother Tongue",

    "reviewText": "Bryson has a perceptive account of two middle-aged men setting out with minimal preparation to hike the AT.  He is a good narrative writer, although you will not mistake his prose for Ian McEwan.  But he is consistently amusing, with 8-10 'laugh out loud' lines in the book.About 20% of his book is ideological cant of the 'modified Luddite' variety.  One is always thankful to avoid the full-out Luddite variety in a hiking book (&quot;Wouldn't we all be better off living the simple life in huts and nice bonfires for heat?&quot;).  Bryson's is of the 'modified Luddite' form in that he argues for turning the clock back only 100 years or so instead of 1000.  For example, he yearns (ad nauseam) for the restoration of farming to the Delaware Valley and tries to position himself 'in the middle' between the hard left 'back to nature' crowd and the world of progress as we know it.It would have been a better (albeit shorter) book without all the diversions into his mild-leftist, political ideology.  For example, he argues that because &quot;some naturalists think&quot; the moose population of New England is 20% less than the State Park system does, under the very limited state-sanctioned hunting program, &quot;the moose aren't so much culled as slaughtered.&quot;  (Pg. 242) Such non-sequiturs bred of leftist ideology abound, but can be overlooked bythe thoughtful reader.  Moreover, one can always be thankful it wasn't worse.On the other hand, it may not be Bryson's fault.  It may well be that the publisher presumes leftist ideological cant is part of its target audience for hiking books.  We shall never know.  But the book would have been five stars without it.All in all, a pleasing (though sometimes tendentous) way to gain an appreciation for the terrain and context of the AT.",

    "reviewText": "Bill Bryson's engaging narrative of hiking the Appalachian Trail makes excellent and oft-hillarious reading.  Taking on the trail with his friend Stephen Katz, the two struggle with 40-pound packs as they head north from the mountains of northern Georgia.  Their destination is the upper woodlands of Maine some 2,100 miles away.  Readers feel as if they are moving alongside the pair as they struggle with terrain that ranges from moderate to difficult to downright frightening.  One moment they are struggling up a steep mountainside, later they swiftly descent into a foggy-shrouded forest.  Along the way they encounter danger, serenity, fear, insects, animals, loneliness, laughter, and a few other hikers - and they sleep on the oft-cold ground in tents or crude shelters.  Readers comprehend the joy the two experience at finding a cheap motel and a McDonald's after many days on the trail.  Bryson and Katz didn't quite traverse all 2,100 miles, skipping sections in Tennessee, Pennsylvania and elsewhere.  Still, they hiked a distance longer than New York to Chicago in those spring and summer months.  All is told by Bryson in his easy-reading style.  Having hiked a small portion of the trail (in Tennessee) this witty narrative was like deja vu all over again.",

About motherhood and loss.The writing is vivid, mindful of all the senses, at one point commenting on the mouth feel of a word. Freeman does a good job of using Sri Lankan words (I'm guessing they're words in the country's official language of Sinhalese, but I'm not sure) and translating them, in context, without it being awkward and without the book being twice as long as it otherwise could be.While I don't understand the choices these women made, I can begin to understand the helpless, stuck feeling their choices sometimes stemmed from. And the regret they felt over some past actions. I may not go so far as to call them sympathetic characters, but I think they are realistically drawn.A Disobedient Girl is haunting, tragic. It has stayed with me. I could see what was coming and hoped I was wrong, but I wasn't.I'm tempted to call this women's fiction, a class of books I don't think I like. This book rises a bit above that crowd, though, as it draws attention to societal issues and failures.Freeman was born into a family of writers in Colombo, Sri Lanka. After a year of informal study at Murdoch University in Australia, she arrived in the United States to attend Bates College in Maine. She completed her master's in labor relations at the University of Colombo and worked in the field of American and international humanitarian assistance and workers' rights.

It did more then call out some of the men in the industry, such as Diddy, Ice T, and JaRule...to name a few. Karrine was searching for love that she never received at home. While it did reveal the horrible way women are treated in the music industry, it also displayed the mindset of most of the women that are considered groupies. They are insecure and looking for someone to validate their existence.Looking past all of the glamour, she did have quite a childhood. Karrine had a mom who never loved her and was practically jealous of her.  She was abused by her mother and raped, not only by a neighbor but also by her own husband. Her father was an absent figure in her life. She had no one to turn to. So she turned to the one thing that most women with that background turn to: SEX! Of course she still had a choice, and she definitely made some wrong choices. She allowed her self to be used at times, because she thought she had no choice.I believe this book is a great tool to use as an example for young women who may be in similar situations. Hopefully they can glean from Karrine's mistakes and see that they can make better choices. Being a groupie or video girl is NOT all it seems to be.Reviewer Donnica CopelandAPOOO BookClub",

This audio is also read by the author.Bill Bryson moved to Hanover, New Hampshire, and soon after realizes the the Appalachian Trail, at least part of it, is close by. After doing some reading about the trail, he thought it would be pretty cool to hike the trail which runs from Georgia to Maine. He solicits friends and family to join him, and even puts notes in his holiday cards inviting people to hike \"the trail\".The only person to respond to his invitation was an old college buddy, that he never got along with too well...Steven Katz. The two of them are like the \"odd couple\". Bryson is very prepared, having shopped for all the essentials for the trip, and packed very well. Katz, is like Oscar with his duffle bag well packed with Snickers Bars and Little Debbie cakes, all the essentials he felt he'd need. When Katz' bag gets a little too heavy, he tosses the water bottle...who needs water on a hike in the South right?. Their hike began in Georgia, and last about 6 weeks or 500 miles.The book was very amusing. In addition there is a bit of history about the Appalachian Trail, as well as environmental and ecological issues neatly laced into the story. Great travel Memoir.",

    "reviewText": "The cover:This is my favorite cover in the series. I like that the four girls are on one cover :).The storyline:It might include minor spoilers for the book itself and not the other books in the series.Unlike the other books in the series, which have each chapter with a different point of view from each of the girls, in this book we have four parts for the four girls and each part has chapters from that girl's point of view. It is more organized in a way.So for this review, I'll do ratings for each part separately and then I'll make the big conclusion.1st: Hanna: 2.5/5 stars:To me, Hanna's story was the worst one. I couldn't sympathize with her or feel sorry for her.In this book, Hanna's father, his wife Isabel and her daughter Kate are staying with Hanna' in her house.And as usual, Hanna struggles to be on good terms with her Dad and with herself. She feels weak, alone and not loved after what Mona did and how her father treats her now that he has a new family including a new daughter. Also Lucas goes on vacation with an old family friend which, to her, make things only worse.So, she decides to join a fitness club afraid to get chubby again and to get her mind off \"A\", and while she's not sure whether she has to or not, the fitness trainer definitely gets her attention and she decides to join in for him. And that's when the disasters start.She suddenly decides that what she wants is a new romance with an older guy and she does everything  to get him, only she's pushing him away.All this is happening while she's still with Lucas, her boyfriend.You can imagine the end yourself and you might not get it right, that's why I'm not spoiling the book for you anymore.2nd: Emily: 5/5 stars!Emily's story was the best in the book. It is about friendship, family, loyalty and kindness.In her part of the book, Emily is still mourning Ali's death and she's trying so hard to be brave for herself and her family now that they're all gathered and trying to make her feel welcomed and loved.Just in time for Christmas, while everyone is getting ready, things start to disappear getting stolen by a group of girls who call themselves the Merry Elves, and Emily's mother gets a thing of hers stolen too, so what happens is that she asks for Emily for help (catching the girls in the act).Emily gets into a lot of different situations with different aspects and begins to question what she's really doing while trying to please her mom and yet still true to herself.The end is epic!3rd: Aria: 3/5 stars:I usually hate Aria (not Lucy Hale!) the most out of the four girls. She's too sensitive, too emotional, always trying to find love and most importantly, sometimes she's just too stupid to endure.In her story, the family reunion she's been waiting for for so long is ruined by the coming of Meredith. Yes, she just gets angry and acts with nonsense but I somehow understand her anger. Anyways, she's back in Rosewood and an old crush from Iceland is there looking for her!She feels like it's finally getting better and maybe she's finally going to be happy again. Until that crush of hers crushes her down along with the law...The end? Just ok. Could've been worse.4th: Spencer: 4/5 stars:Spencer's story was actually intriguing. With the family drama, her being the one who told on Ian and her sister hating her, her life couldn't get any worse. Well, think again!The Hastings are staying at Nana's house for their vacation and Spencer decides she needs to relax and have a relationship (she says: \"a ling\") to get her mind off of things. Thinks start to look very promising, the guy notices her then he's into her, her sister is talking to her and even her mom seems to be noticing her again. Oh well, things are about to flip upside down!Spencer gets stabbed in the back, betrayed and discovers a really bad and nasty truth. Just when things start to look very bad (even I thought she's going to get the bad end again), she gets help from the last person she thought would help her ever. And then what an end, the second best one in this book after Emily's (although it could easily be the opposite ;)).In general:What I loved:- Emily's character.- The writing is as always really good.- The family drama, the relationships and how real they were.- \"A\" `s point of view at the end of each part. I just love it!What I hated:- The girls desperate tries to fall in love.- How all the girls' vacations (except for Emily's) are about finding a guy. I find this completely nonsense.- There motives, behaviors and decisions were mostly made at an angry moment without giving it second thought.Favorite quotes:The four girls continued to glare. Emily was sure they could hear her galloping heart. She was about to apologize again, but then Cassie burst out laughing, lunged forward, and wrapped Emily in a huge hug. Heather circled her arms around Emily, and then Lola and Sophie joined in, too. Emily remained stiff for a few moments, and then tentatively squeezed back. --- Emily's Pretty Little Secret: Chapter 16: The Whole World was at Peace.Just after they'd professed their affection for one another, A had exposed their relationship. Ezra had resigned from his teaching position immediately and taken off to Rhode Island. Since he'd been gone, Aria felt like she had PTED--Post-Traumatic Ezra Disorder. She couldn't stop thinking about him. --- Aria's Pretty Little Secret: Chapter 1: The More the Merrier at Solstice Time.Colin took a few steps toward her. \"Are you a new member of my cheering section?\" Spencer cocked her head. \"I don't really do cheering sections--unless I'm the athlete being cheered on. But maybe I could make an exception.\" --- Spencer's Pretty Little Secret: Chapter 2: Cute Boys Make Everything Better.Conclusion:One advice first: read this book in its order! After you read Unbelievable. If you don't read it in the order and leave it for later, you might get confused and things start to get messed up in your mind.This book was a fun quick read (although I took almost 2 months to get it done thanks to my reading slump...). To me, it wasn't a necessary read, you can read the rest of the books without it, you're not missing anything important. It is just nice to know while the new \"A\" was getting ready, what were the girls doing.",

I felt it would have been more powerful if the author had included an epilog, bringing the loose ends of his story together by describing how his experience has impacted his life going forward and influenced his wife, sons, sisters and perhaps even colleagues and friends.",

Bryson successfully blends narrative and fact into a truly  entertaining book.  Unfortunately, a recent trip to one of the areas  described in the book has revealed that at least one of his facts is  already out of date: more than 95% of the Frasier firs in Smokey Mountains  National Park have succumbed now to disease.

    "reviewText": "This book is worth a read. Dr Alexander is a professional specializing in the human brain, its diseases and its function. Here , you have the testimony of someone who cannot be accused of being a wishful hysteric in his description of his post life experiences. When Alexander says, that after he recovered from his death experience, he reviewed his medical charts and confirmed that he was ABSOLUTELY brain dead, we can believe him. He is the authority.However, there is an aspect of his account that leaves me sorry for him. His relating of his experience seems to have failed to cause him to submit to the 'Light'. He , yet, maintains much of the intellectual impudence that raises barriers to full submission to the actuality of God; at least, that is my take on what he relates to us.",

The word &#34;Proof&#34; in the title however is proof to Dr Alexander, he being the one who had the experience; for the reader it is a strong &#34;testament&#34; to maintaining individual identity and continuity of mortal relationships in the great beyond, and that the evils of the present world are swallowed up in an enormity of goodness beyond mortal description. However for the reader, it is not likely that reading about NDEs will translate into a truly moving, soul- changing, &#34;born-again&#34; type of spiritual experience, as it typically is with those who live the experience. It is clear from this and other writings that experiencing Divinity is a spiritual experience and not just a mental exercise or study, and can only be understood by spiritual means. I would recommend the reader become immersed in God's established Word and LIVE the Word sincerely to approach a mortal spiritual experience; then Dr Alexander's experience and that of many others can be comprehended much more intimately than words on a page.",

For those scientists whose feet are firmly planted in this particular camp, the notion of the spirit as something separate from the workings of the brain brinks on the absurd. Before Alexander's coma due to E-coli, an illness for adults that occurs in around one in ten million people, and to fully recover is nothing less than miraculous. The doctor's `conscious experiences' while in this coma for seven days, is the books purpose: to report to fellow medical colleagues and the layman that consciousness does in fact go beyond our current understanding of the brain.What is so different in Alexander's account to other such experiences is that he was not `aware' of his earthly identity which, according to the author, enabled him to `travel' further into realms of consciousness or dimensions.There is a quote from a well- known physicist that if the concepts of Quantum Mechanics have not scared you in anyway, you've not understood the discoveries. Doctor Alexander touches on Quantum theory in this book and interlinks the notions of NDE's and his experiences while in a coma, adeptly.It is well known to some that science has moved so far that spirituality/philosophy is now being explored by scientists to help explain the unexplainable. Alexander has made a valuable contribution to this project.If you have any interest in NDE's, this is the text to read as it, in one way, helps us understand the phenomenon, but also raises more questions, than it does, answers...",

What we know of her is that she was the best ruler of England (king or queen) that the country has seen.  Even Queen Victoria doesn't seem to really compare.  But in Miles's book Elizabeth is portrayed, not as a stern queen, but as a woman with emotions and desires.  Her scandalous relationship with Robert Dudley is shown as a genuine affection between them.  Even Elizabeth's attitude towards her troublesome cousin, Mary of Scots didn't seem to be very harsh.  When asked to sign her death notice, Elizabeth hesitated for many months and even years before she went through with it.  She had compassion towards family; she restored all the titles her Boleyn side of the family lost when her mother was executed.  In general she seemed like an actually human being.  But I rated this book four stars instead of five because, despite of the excellent reviews, the book was just not very interesting.  I was surprised, since Miles has written excellent books about Guenevere.  A much better book, written by Margaret George would have done Elizabeth justice.",

    "reviewText": "Bill Bryson's A WALK IN THE WOODS:  REDISCOVERING AMERICA ON THE APPALACHIAN TRAIL takes reader up the most revered and legendary walking trails in American history.  The story is somewhat laid-back and may be preferred reading on trip because it reads like a long magazine article or essay, and lends itself to fun reading.  Some critics compare Bill Bryson's writing to Mark Twain's with all its satire and humor and plenty of popular culture references within his narrative.The book begins in Georgia and covers 870 miles north towards the concluding trail that ends in Maine.  Bryson provides an immense amount of information of the history of the trails from its natural state to the dangers that have occurred in the past.  Aside from the humor and dialogue between Bryson and friend, Stephen Katz, the most informative part of the book is how Bryson spotlights the ecological and geological rich history of the trails as well as reference to a little historical trivia pertaining to one well-known Civil War site on the Shenandoah side of the trail, Harpers Ferry where abolitionist John Brown attempted to liberate the slaves.The Appalachian Trail is a part of Americana and American history.  Although there is a hint of a little romanticism of the past on Bryson's part, he interweaves the past with the present, and shows readers that despite progress, industrial and corporate development that surrounds the trails, the trails are still intact with its natural splendor and its big brown bears.",

I seem myself more like his friend Katz, willing but no where NEAR being prepared to do this hike! At times  he drifted into political and conservation type rants, all of them deserving of the rants but somewhat detracting from the Trail story. (my opinion) That's why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. His description of the different sections as the trail courses thru the states makes me want to choose Virginia as the section I'd like to try. It sounds beautiful! And I have NO desire to do the north end, up thru Maine and the Hundred Mile Wilderness!! You young guys can deal with that...[...], I should have done this trail 30 years ago!!What's funny is just a couple weeks back we did a small day hike in north Georgia on the High Shoals trail, down to a beautiful water fall, just a 1.2 mile hike. On the hike back up to the car I was huffing and puffing, my hip was hurting, I was sweating heavily in GOOD weather... and I think I want to do this with a 40 pound pack on my back??!! LOL, I must laugh at myself. Driving up a rough mountain fire road on our way to that hike we crossed over the AT. There was room to pull over, so we stopped to get our bearing (yes, we were lost). As we're trying to figure out where we were and where the High Shoals trailhead is, a guy comes hiking down the AT and pauses to eat his lunch. About 3 minutes later another hiker appears. During our 20 minutes there we saw 6 guys come down that trail! We spoke with the first two guys, one who wanted to celebrate his 65 birthday on the trail, the other guy, much younger, hiking the trail for several days on his own. They both had a slightly dazed but determined look as they spoke of the crowded shelter from the previous night, almost 20 hikers in there! I topped off their water bottles and thanked them, thinking I should do this hike!Who knows, maybe when the weather turns cooler (it's turning hot now) I can get a friend to hike a few days out there with me... the book has me dreaming about it! Good book, I really enjoyed it and want to find more about hiking the trail. Plus, I'm having fun researching gear on the web!Hope you enjoy the book as much as I did!!Back to browsing for gear...",

However, I wasn't completely convinced, obviously, since that was a ridiculous idea! He does give a nice account of his experience and a lot of science about why it was an NDE, not a dream or hallucination. For me, the one thing I need to know is that I will be with my sons when my time does come, and he says otherwise.Overall his experience was amazing and his recovery was nothing short of miraculous.

    "reviewText": "Narrated against the backdrop of America's oldest and most extensively preserved natural forrests, Bryson re-tells the story of how he and his friend, Steven Katz, braved 500 miles over a span of many, many weeks hiking along \"the longest continuous footpath in the world, the Appalachian Trail\", beginning from one Amicalola Falls Lodge in Atlanta to Front Royal, Virginia; and then meeting up again a few months later to continue on along the same trail towards Mt. Katahdin through the famous Hundred Mile Wilderness.Personally i liked it in the beginning  because i thought it was simply hilarious, the way Bryson spiritedly and rather presumptously decided to hike the AT one day simply because he got excited with all that fancy camping and outdoor gear in the store. However as the story progressed i found myself drawn to how he proceeded to describe the AT, it's humble beginnings and the general surrounding forrest environment, from both flora and fauna, with facts that denote extensive research and a great understanding of the subject. Even more appealing was how easy to read the content was despite having quite a generous few pages filled with historical facts & geographical statistics.He has an almost uncanny sense of humour and what has been written on paper is almost as clear as being there first hand. I laughed out loud several times while on the public train. It was something i could not help doing. I enjoyed the way he described the various people he met and interacted with along the way from the annoying & patronizing Mary Ellen to \"Chicken John\", the guy on Stratton Mountain with the Enviro Meter to the four noisy, boistrous, safari attired high-and-mighties he encountered at one of the AT shelters.A deep sense of sadness overcame me tho when he proceeded to describe how unchecked logging, state approved killing of certain predatory animals in the late 1800s, diseases introduced from foreign lands, the over zealous collection of rare and endangered spieces of plants have forever changed the face of the forrests along the AT from what it used to be just 50 or so yrs ago.When i finished the book I came away feeling a great respect and even greater humility for MOTHER NATURE by all her beauty, majesty, her great expanse of power and seemingly never ending ability to shock and amaze even the most seasoned hiker. Bryson's acute observation and ability to paint that very picture with stunning clearity by combining such in-depth factual information with bursts of wittisisms make this book worth the read anytime anywhere.Having said that it was rather a downer to discover somewhere along the middle, just when things were getting exciting, that the story would not cover his adventures in the woods for the entire 2,200 miles of the AT cause he never did hike the entire length of it. Rather, he hiked the trail in several segments...finishing off with the 100 Mile Wilderness reunited with Katz again some months later.",

    "reviewText": "I'm going to address the abuse Ophelia suffered, which I see many other reviewers have objected to. First of all - I do understand why other reviewers are upset. It was tolerated if not outright accepted and maybe this is not a book for younger girls who may misunderstand that this is not a good example of what they should do in a similar situation. HOWEVER, what the other reviewers are maybe not seeing is that, very unfortunately - it was portrayed accurately. Many victims of abuse will act similarly to how Ophelia did. It's not right and I wish it was different, but that's how it is. I've worked with victims of domestic abuse for the past three years - some are tolerant and even accepting of what was done to them for a variety of reasons. In this story, Ophelia was trying to help Hamlet - was trying to be his outlet and give him what he needed. Is it right? No. But it does happen. This book was not ADVOCATING abuse and saying hey, it's okay as long as you're upset, just like it is not saying that murder is okay. It was simply portraying a situation in which abuse was happening. And I'm not sure why people are surprised by the abuse. Did no one read the original play?Onto the book itself - I thought this was a rather excellent retelling of Hamlet, grim and harsh, from the point of view of someone who was an ally but who was also very wronged by that complex character and just a hint of magic and the supernatural.  I really enjoyed this exploration of Hamlet and Ophelia's relationship. Dark, sweet, complex, and no, not always pleasant which made it all the more realistic. I loved how the author gave the characters a bit of her own interpretation - especially Horatio. All in all, I couldn't put it down. I thought it was very well done. This author has a lot of talent and I will be seeking out more of her work.",

A Walk in the Woods is humorous, but falls somewhere in the middle along the continuum of Bryson's funny to serious books. His hard-core, realistic descriptions of what he and his friend endured made me ache sympathetically for him.I have a friend who hiked the Trail and learning that parts of the Trail are in barely hikeable condition or undecipherable (or unmapped) was sad. This is one of our National Treasures, people. (But thanks to the volunteers who do tend to their portions!)Lastly, I was glad that Bryson included tales of the areas where man has harmed Nature - perhaps forever, such as in the town that had had to be abandoned because of underground coal mine fires that could not be extinquished. It's a sad day when a heralded nature trail can't be enjoyed without also witnessing some of the 20th century's disasters, but I'm glad Bryson called them to our attention.",

    "reviewText": "The longest hike I have done, in terms of distance, is the Chilkoot Trail in Alaska. As a tour guide, I have time to spare between my jaunts across the state and took three days in the summer of 2012 to hike with a buddy along the length of this tremendously historic trail. It is 33 miles. Not even a fingernail scratch on a map of the Appalachian Trail, and because of this I have enormous respect for the out-of-shape Bryson and Katz who managed hundreds of miles of the AT, even if they didn't complete it.'A Walk in the Woods' is a fun book, and a good travelogue. In terms of personal description of their experience, Bryson is tremendously journalistic, and equally humorous. He takes himself not at all too seriously, and his jokes and his thoughts on the trail and hiking generally, were a joy to read. As a Washingtonian, i've grown up hiking and camping and can attest to many of his observations, such as the zen mode achieved when walking great distances and the increasing lack of attention paid to hygiene and your stomach, the longer you are in the woods. His imagined reaction to what would happen if he ran across a bear, (it involved the ruining of his underwear and likelihood of death through a 'blown sphincter') were laugh out loud funny.As any good travelogue should, he included anecdotal history throughout the work and opined on some of the more poignant aspects of American attitudes towards nature. His history of the trail I found altogether uninteresting (it would likely be more exciting, if I was in the midst of hiking the AT), but his notations on the Forest Service and Park Service were excellent. The Forest Service's primary function being the construction of roads through the nations wilderness, in order to better allow timber companies to access the 49 million acres of harvestable land. The Park Service, with a history of hurting the land when attempting to assist it, has gone to the other extreme and now will not interfere with diminishing grass lands, even if their assistance would be 'demonstrably beneficial'.His most wonderful observation though is worth quoting. In regards to Americas attitude towards nature, he says,\"...alas, beauty has become something you drive to, and nature an either/or proposition--either you ruthlessly subjugate it, or you deify it, treat it as something holy and remote, a thing apart, as along the Appalachian Trail.\" This was the most impacting line of the book for me.Lastly, his relationship with Katz is heartfelt. You can sense the companionship and humor of their interactions. And, at the end of the book, when Katz has had a brief relapse into drinking, the monologue he gives is just genuine and intimate. A look at the lonely life a former alcoholic could easily occupy once he has said goodbye to the sauce.Overall, this is a great book that made me a huge fan of Bryson. Recommended, so long as you can trudge through his odd justification for only completing a portion of the trail and then returning to particular sections in day hikes and drives. It felt piece-meal, and easily could have been excluded from the book. As other reviewers have said, the work lost momentum in the second half, but it is still more than worth the read.",

It has many hilarious passages. I liked Bryson's  criticism of the AT as well; that it might have some more places where  there was an interface between rural areas, and wilderness. I have always  found these interfaces the most magical and inspiring. (Although some are  unfortunately ugly as well.) As one who has hiked sections of the AT, I  thought it was an excellent depiction of the people and trial itself.",

Jack Coughlin, a veteran sniper for the Marines, and Capt. Casey Kuhlman, also a marine.  Think about what a sniper does.  Apart from being an expert marksman, this job cannot be easy, for many reasons, and this book explains why.  Coughlin tells a touching story of his father's work ethic, which he in turn learned, his own passion for baseball, how he was nearly blinded by a sharp stone thrown by neighborhood kids, and how he joined the Marines at nineteen where he discovered he was a great marksman despite never having used a gun before.  There's more to being a sniper and his comment, \"...there is no such thing as a stupid sniper,\" resonates well throughout the book.",

    "reviewText": "\"Heaven\" aside: this is a fascinating story about the medical trauma endured by Dr. Eben Alexander, a prominent neurological surgeon who suffered life-threatening bacterial meningitis.  Dr. Alexander has written a heartrending book about his sudden, excruciatingly painful illness. His wife and sisters keep vigil at his bedside.  His young son struggles to cope; his hospital colleagues struggle to help.  Each person in this story is a genuine character who we come to care about as they move through grief and hope and ultimately to joy when he recovers. In particular, the back story of his own adoption (and search to connect with his birth family) is poignant, with mixed emotions all around.  As a doctor, Alexander includes background on neurology. How does the tissue of the human brain give rise to an intelligent \"self?\" Is there something beyond the cellular matter inside our head that makes us \"us?\" As he describes his own illness, he explains brain science clearly but with a sound technical basis, including the different schools of thought about how the brain gives rise to consciousness.Of course, the point of the book is Dr. Alexander's own near-death experience. He tells this story as authentically as possible, making clear when words are inadequate and when his metaphors are limited. Given these limitations, he does well evoking a reality where there is no physical sensation, no time as we know it, and no memory of earthly identity. There are only a few chapters that describe the \"afterlife,\" with much more of the book dedicated to his medical experience and the biology of the brain. But I was satisfied to see that quite a few things were included that had not been in the Newsweek article (a precursor to the book's release) and news stories about it. This includes his experience of a dark, claustrophobically fleshy realm and a much different realm of vast brightness that he experiences as being in the presence of God (although he is cautious about naming God and does not dwell on Christ or other organized religion - which will disappoint some as much as it appeals to others).  I'll also admit I was a little thrilled at the story of the \"girl on the butterfly wing,\" especially when he finally recognized her.I know it is a stretch to call this \"proof.\" It is one person's experience and it cannot be observed or repeated by others, as science requires. But death will always be that way. It is fascinating that, with all we can know about human biology, the mystery of consciousness and death remain just out of our grasp. Those who want to disbelieve Dr. Alexander's story will do so.  That is human nature, and we're all skeptics about something -- it takes doubt as well as faith to keep humanity's quest for knowledge driving ever forward.  For those who are inclined to believe, or who are not sure, Dr. Alexander's story is certainly food for thought. Personally I cannot say I'm 100% convinced. But I will say that in my own soul, the images and experience he described resonated with a feeling not unlike familiarity.  IF this is true - if Heaven is out there- it might well be like this.",

Some books I've read about the AT are so dry, like \"I walked 8.2 miles and stayed in Hilbilly shelter, then I got up and walked 11.1 miles....\"  He does go off on tangents about alot of things, so what I got from it was it wasn't really that much about the AT.  I didn't think he complained alot like some people said.  He did describe  better than most  the parts of the AT that he did see.  Also, I believe the fantatical thru-hikers seem to think the AT belongs to them and there is no merit in doing short hikes.  I'm glad the book wasn't really about a thru-hike.  I liked his descriptions  and humor but I could also see where some people who lack a sense of humor wouldn't get him.  It's an enjoyable read, but if you are a serious, fantatical hiker, just accept this book for what it is. I give him credit for walking any of the trail and even started to like Katz before it was all said and done. If you are really serious about hiking the trail, I would suggest getting a variety of authors and their perspectives.  Normally I don't like authors reading their own books, but in this case if anyone else had read it, I don't think it would have had as much impact.",

I suppose this and a natural curiosity is what drew me to `Proof of Heaven' by Dr. Eben Alexander.The author is a neurosurgeon and also the victim of an extraordinarily rare spontaneous e. coli infection that nearly killed him.  `Proof of Heaven' is his cathartic missive that chronicles what he encountered as he lay comatose and near death for a week.This is an interesting story particularly because of the scientific background of the author.  Who, by his own admission, had a very difficult time in the belief of a God or life after death.  His NDE was transformational.First, there is the fact that Dr. Alexander is regarded in the scientific literature as a medical miracle. Given the severity of his illness the chances of his simple survival were slim to none.  Were he to survive the anticipated outcome was life in a persistent vegetative state. However, he not only survived but against all odds made a seemingly full recovery.While in coma, the author was present in body only. One that remained unresponsive as the e. coli ate away at his neo-cortex.  However, outside of the spacial-temporal world that defines material consciousness, Dr. Alexander was on the journey of his life.  By his account he traveled beyond an earthly existence to a place better defined by levels of increasing spiritual awareness and enlightenment. Unconditional love was at the core of this state-of-being.This physician, against years of academic and clinic training and application of scientific method now believes that true health can only be achieved when one realizes that God and the soul are real.  Too, death is not an end of personal existence, but rather a transition.This is a story that is difficult to ignore and a book I would highly recommend for those with even a cursory interest in the subject matter.",

I've even had experiences similar to his.What I came away with was two-fold. One, seeing some of my own experiences validated in print, unexpectedly, ended up doing nothing for me. Two, no matter how transcended an experience is, nothing makes up for the educating and change-causing effect of a long journey &#34;there,&#34; as opposed to a leap, such as is caused by a near death experience. I very much hope to read more from Mr Alexander once his ordinary life experience has caught up to his transcended experience.",

    "reviewText": "Bill Bryson can sometimes be too cute for my liking, but his style works well in this book.  With his sometimes trusty sidekick Katz, who is totally out of his element here, the two decide to hike the Adirondack Trail from Georgia to Maine.  Bryson keeps things light and breezy, but at the same time, the difficulties of such an undertaking are shown; the cold, the rain and snow, and the anxieties about getting lost and running into wild animals.  There are many interesting and humorous moments here, getting a wild ride from a young couple in Georgia, having a woman tag along with them and drive them crazy, staying with many others in a slummy bunkhouse, Katz disappearing in the middle of nowhere and so on.  After a long time hiking and checking the map to see that they had not travelled far at all, one could really appreciate the vast distance they had to walk.  Bryson more than once says that the walk was monotonous and pointless in many ways, which is why he eventually had to skip many sections.  His walk in the coal mining country of Pennsylvania was among the most interesting, especially the town with fault cracks throughout.  Living in a New England college town Bryson goes a bit overboard with his uneasiness about \"rednecks\" but his comments are made in fun and it's more about being a fish out of water than anything else.  This book is just a fun read, and if approached in this way it is enjoyable.",

    "reviewText": "First, my criticisms:This book was not as entertaining as the 1996 bestseller, \"You'll Never Make Love in This Town Again.\"  I remember reading that book when I resided in Los Angeles, but I really hadn't read another \"erotic memoir\" and/or \"Hollywood Kiss & Tell\" type book until Ms. Karrine Steffans arrived on the scene (Ms. Steffans has been one of my MySpace 'Friends' for a while now).  Actually, I really wish a book about former Entertainment Industry attorney Angela Wallace would come out.  I think that book would potentially blow \"Confessions\" out of the water.Sadly, being a person who has pursued a career in the Entertainment Industry myself, very little in this book truly \"shocked\" me or even surprised me.  I think women will find this book much more interesting than the average male would.  Men (both in the Entertainment Industry and outside of it) already know what's up.  All you have to do is watch HBO's \"Entourage\" to get a glimpse of the Hollywood lifestyle from the male perspective.Over half of the reason why most men want to be rich and/or famous is so they score more women.  It's really that simple.  Most guys who are singers, musicians, TV stars, Movie stars, Hip-Hop/Rap stars, stand-up comics, or any other Entertainment Industry VIP type would never be able to attract and seduce the quantity and/or quality of women that they now do if it weren't for their wealth and fame.  Even a knucklehead like Pauly Shore scores chicks in Hollywood.  C'mon people.  Pauly Shore??Did anyone ever read \"Pimp: The Story of My Life??\"  If not, you should.  Robert Beck a.k.a. \"Iceberg Slim\" breaks it down in that book.  In that book, he essentially says that the vast majority of women have an ultra-kinky, masochistic, submissive, and promiscuous side of them just begging for the right opportunity to reveal itself (take note men! Read \"PIMP\" and \"Mode One\").  Ms. Steffans is a prime example of that.  Her story has very little to do with her adverse upbringing.  Even if Ms. Steffans had been raised by a college-educated, church-going mother with a few morals and ethics, I truly believe Karrine's story would still be essentially the same.  Why?  Because Ms. Steffans was DYING to become famous.  She's star-struck.  When you're star-struck, especially if you're a woman, you'll do just about anything to achieve wealth, fame, and the glamorous life.  I used to live in Hollywood, CA (right on Hollywood Blvd, in between Fairfax and LaBrea).  I met plenty of aspiring actresses, singers, models, and music video girls.  I know their story.My comments and/or compliments:A lot of people criticize Ms. Steffans for writing and publishing this book, but I don't.  It's smart business.  Women love to read gossip (men do too, but not quite as much as the average woman).  Why do you think tabloids like \"The Star\" and \"The Nationals Enquirer\" are so popular??  The Wall Street Journal would go out of business before tabloid magazines ever will.  Ms. Steffans gave her audience just what her nosy, gossipy demographic wanted to read:  \"juicy\" behind-the-scenes details of all of her erotic trysts with well-known male celebrities.  \"Is so-and-so packin' (i.e., well endowed)??  Does that one rapper have stamina?  Is that one studly movie star sensuous and kinky in bed??\"  These are questions that most women 18-35 want answered.  And Ms. Steffans doesn't disappoint.I congratulate Karrine on her new career as an author.  Being a book author can be a very rewarding and satisfying career.  If this book is her entry into the world of books and publishing, more power to her.  To the guys who were \"called out\" in this book:  Can you really be upset??  You make your bed, you lie in it.  Ever heard of a \"confidentiality agreement??\"  Prince, the singer and musicians, knows all about those (hint, hint, wink, wink).  I think the aspect of this book being a true \"cautionary tale\" is over-hyped.  This book is good entertainment ... nothing more, nothing less.  This book will not dissuade any aspiring actress from making the same mistakes Ms. Steffans made.  They will have to gain wisdom as they experience their climb on the Hollywood ladder.",

I couldn't even imagine what her experience had been like and this book gave me some understanding of the experience.  Do I think the AT hikers are crazy?  Absolutely!  Am I a little envious of their experiences?  A resounding Yes!  Conflicting emotions about the whole thing?

What makes this book fascinating is that it is written by a scientist who before his experience did not have much of a spiritual belief system.  However, once he got back, he became a believer and now is on a quest to share his story.The book also delves into Eben's own insecurities and the internal struggles that have consumed so much of his life.

Parts of the book are technical and told to get the attention of scientists, but that is not the majority of the book. I read the book in preparation for his visit to my town and I am glad that I did. I find his story comforting and quite similar to other accounts of near death experiences. The book and his appearance leave lots of questions, but he is still writing and has a website. We will always have questions, but that is part of our journey on this earth.

What comes through clearly is the very aggressive attitude of the Marine Corp and the author's desire to participate in the fighting. This is counter-pointed by an incident late in the campaign which obviously left a deep impression on the author and highlights the difficulties of modern fighting and trying to prevent civilian casualties.What also comes through clearly are the problems of trying to maintain a family life and being in an elite military unit. These problems led to the author's marriage breaking down and to his decision to leave the Marine Corp. He also details some of the frustrations he found serving with some people who are less than professional and his disgust at one person in particular being rewarded for his service was another reason for leaving the Corps.All in all, an intersting book with insight at what motivates a sniper but I would have liked to see more about the author's life other than in Iraq.",

She has an epiphany on the day of her wedding and leaves her dress on a tree as she high tails out of North Dakota and into Oregon to live with a crazy Aunt. There she develops friendships with some quirky women, all of whom have their own tales of abuse.Some of the abusive scenes and descriptions are hard to read.

Yeah, if you didn't know what genre this book was, you could probably make an educated guess.The second story consists of flashbacks, most of which revolve around the women's escapades in college, apparently to whet our appetites and give us several little precursors to their imminent ordeal at the Totem Pole Lodge. These chapters could be compared to the flashbacks on \"Lost,\" which didn't necessarily have anything to do with the present-day story but told us more about where the characters came from and what made them tick. I'm giving \"Blood Games\" the benefit here, because otherwise it looks like Richard Laymon just rewrote and slapped together two originally unrelated manuscripts to fill his page quota.The book's first half is more concerned with character than with that pesky thing called \"plot.\" Not only does nothing major happen in the present, but the flashback chapters take up a LOT of these first 200 pages. So you'll really have to make an effort to like the five heroines if you want to be invested in the second half. Not the easiest thing in the world. The only one I consistently cared about was Abilene, the level-headed POV protagonist. Everyone else--the headstrong Cora, the feisty Finley, the spoiled beauty Vivian, and the physically unattractive sympathy magnet Helen--fluctuates at best. Yes, even Helen suffers because the book doesn't really focus on her image problems until quite a ways in.But I got used to them all. And y'know what? The rest of \"Blood Games\" was enjoyable and suspenseful enough. Plus, on their own, the flashback chapters are pretty entertaining, maybe even preferable during the book's first half. They get less interesting towards the end, but that's when hell breaks loose at the lodge and delivers a finale typical of Richard Laymon. It's not the best finale he's ever written, but I don't regret the ride there.7/10",

He describes, in vivid detail, the people he meets on and off the trail, the conditions of the trail, and his experiences, to the point where when I do some day hikes on the AT I just may recognize something he's talked about.  Another great attribute of this book is that this is not solely the story of Bryson and his friend Katz hiking the AT; Bryson also describes the history of the trail, the environmental concerns surrounding the trail, and so much other information about the trail and the people who have been affected by it.  Bryson's wit and sarcasm make even the driest history of the trail interesting, and reading the book definitely makes the reader want to get up and hike the trail, or at least part of it.",

In particular, I felt this way about the chapter, late in the book, where he went into how \"scientific\" the notion of consciousness is.I've seen the 20/20 and Nightline segments on Dr. Alexander, and I think you can get most of the gist of his experience from that, though the book goes into more detail about his medical condition and certainly his background and his near-death experience as well.Still, it's a good addition to the literature on life after death if you're interested in the subject and a fast read.",

    "reviewText": "Dr. Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven is by far the most convincing account of heaven that I've ever read, and I've read at least five accounts, including the bestselling Heaven is For Real, Flight to Heaven, and 90 Minutes in Heaven.  As of date, Proof of Heaven still remains #1 on the New York Times Best Sellers List.I am fascinated by the fact that many of these accounts are strikingly similar.  However, I became somewhat of a skeptic myself when I noticed that most of the books I had read on the afterlife were written by ministers, missionaries, or someone affiliated with a church.  To hear an account from someone who didn't believe in God, didn't go to church, and who had no interest in religious matters, made that account far more believable.  In fact Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon who relied on scientific proof to explain the workings of the world.Unexpectedly infected with bacterial meningitis, Dr. Alexander remained in a coma for seven days. By the end of the week, doctors were convinced that he had no chance of waking, and even if he woke, he would never recover.  But one day he wakes up and eventually completely recovers to the astonishment of the medical community.  During the time he is unconscious, he gives a heartfelt account of what happens to him.  Though Dr. Alexander's voice is thoroughly engaging, his time in heaven is described quite generally.  There are no incredible details of heaven.  The most descriptive he gets is when he talks about puffy, pink-white clouds, flocks of transparent orbs, shimmering beings racing across the sky, and people singing and dancing among trees, fields and waterfalls.  God is referred to as Om, and the most vivid character is a girl on a butterfly wing who accompanies him.However, his descriptions of hell are compelling and disturbing.  Here, Dr. Alexander is almost graphic in his details and his report stays with you for some time.  As a reader, you are so sold on his story that you begin to think that hell really does exist, and that maybe it's a good idea to review the Ten Commandments.  He also spends many pages informing the reader on near-death experiences and where his experience fits in that research.  His insights on spirituality and God are alone well worth the read.",

It was quite amusing how he chose his hiking partner, whose main qualifications seemed to be that he had a pulse, was an acquaintance of Bryson, had nothing else to do at the time, and most importantly, was the only person willing to go.  That he was a bona fide neurotic was a bonus.It's hard to imagine two guys less prepared for a long hike.  As someone for whom being fit is a normal part of life, it's just amazing, even hilarious, to see how people prepare for highly vigorous physical activities.  Bryson's method consisted of asking no one for advice, and taking 2 long walks.  His partner did even less.  Then when they're out on the trail, obviously having a very difficult time, Bryson bitterly resents the fit people racing by him, having no problems lifting their packs overhead when crossing the river.  Nothing about \"maybe I should have actually prepared for the hike\" or anything like that.  I had to chuckle and remind myself that intelligence and writing ability are no guarantee of having the slightest clue about physical activities.To their credit, they did walk a significant length of the trail - not like these high-rollers who pop in, walk a few miles on the trail, and hog the whole campsite because, ew, you other people smell!I enjoyed Bryson's observations about the regions he was walking through, and the historical background of the trail and its environs.  It was somewhat disappointing that they didn't finish the trail, but that's the way life goes sometimes, and despite a complete lack of preparation, by the end he clearly had learned a lot about hiking and the trail.",

So much of what he has to say about hiking rings true as anyone who has been on a hike or a camp out for that matter.  The joy of a motel, with a shower are as heavenly he describes it.When Bill Bryson moved back to the US, after living years in Great Britain, he came up with the idea of hiking the length of the Appalachian Trail.  He tried to talk anyone and everyone into accompanying him and finally an old and very out of shape friend named Stephen Katz agreed.  Their adventure begins by Katz tossing out many necessities to lighten the load and from that point the reader is happy to tag along on their lengthy excursion.But Bryson is not all humor, the reader learns many interesting and entertaining facts about bears, the trail, hiking equipment, history, earth science, the changing face of the woods in America, environmental issues, endangered and extinct animals and natural disasters.I'd happily recommend the book to anyone interested in travel or humor.",

    "reviewText": "I had heard of Bill Bryson, but had never read any of his books. I picked this up at a discount store, and thus began MY adventure. From the moment I started, I was enthralled. In between Bill's recollection of his adventure is littered all kinds of interesting stories and histories of the places visited and the wildlife that lives (or lived) there, and best of all is the humor (my favorite part is his account of reading the book about bear attacks). I was a bit disappointed, as someone already pointed out, he did not hike the entire trail, but I was never the less intrigued by every bit of what he did see.Though I do disagree with some of his science and politics, it doesn't hurt the book one bit. I was glad, I guess you could say, that he does point out that often times conservationists and the Park Service do more harm than good for these National Parks and nature in general.The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the F word and a few other bits of dialogue could have been done without. I realized that it was mostly, if not always, part of a conversation, but still.",

It starts off with two hilarious characters Bryson and Katz, these two main characters in the story have decided to hike the Appalachian Trail. But what lies ahead, is way out of their league. Raining, snow, hail, all of these things comes right into their face on their crazy journey.The book itself is full of many parts of humor, adventure, and wilderness. Even though this book does have that very beautiful nature feeling the overwhelming amount of high school level facts they throw in, in chapter full can become overwhelmingly boring. But even though those facts were included I found this book a very good read, and hope you will decide to read it as well.",

Bryson manages to tell the story with sufficient dry wit and self-deprecation that there are actually several laugh-aloud moments. Add to this his marvellous detailed research into the flora, fauna, history, and politics of the Trail, and his fine descriptions of those moments when he actually came out of his exhaustion-induced stupor long enough to notice the stunning scenery, and you have a fine read. And as he says toward the end of the book, they may not have conquered the trail, but they (or at least, HE) DID hike 870 miles over the course of a spring, summer, and fall (his partner accompanied him for somewhat less than that.) Not bad for a rank amateur who started off out of shape and utterly unwise in the ways of the wilderness. I have to admit, I'm impressed.",

    "reviewText": "[...]My rating: 4 of 5 &#11088;&#65039;Working in Dempsey's Bar & Grill is not exactly what Willow Parsons went to school for, but it's what she has enjoyed doing for the last year since she landed on Anchor Island. Not eager to share the fact she has chosen the small community to hide out in, she has nonetheless been able to make some really good friends here. Only one person unsettles her, partly because his massive size reminds her of someone she never wants to see again, and partly because of the conflictling feelings he brings out in her.Gentle giant, that is how everyone sees Randy Navarro, adventurer and owner of the local gym, but he can't seem to catch a break with Willow. Awkward, since Will and his sister Sid are the best of friends, and they all hang out together on a regular basis. When he notices there isn't simply dislike, but real fear in her eyes, he is determined to make her feel as safe as possible. The preparations for the wedding of their friends offers opportunities to slowly win her trust.Recognizing Randy for the kind man he is, Willow finally is letting down her guard with him, and soon finds herself drawn into a romantic entanglement she did not want to have. But when her worst fears came true, instead of turning to the ones she had come to love, she reacted as she always had.......she ran.*****Warm and Lush!!This is not my first book in the Anchor Island series by Terri Osburn, a series that centres around a small island on the outer banks, and each have left me feeling utterly satisfied.The characters from previous books reappear as supporting cast in HOME TO STAY, but the book is a story by itself, a solid standalone. There is no ongoing backstory that snakes through the series you have to be afraid of missing out on if you don't read the books in sequence or even miss one here or there. A colourful collection of friends are at the core of each story, in their late twenties to mid thirties, each finding their own, sometimes unexpected, happy ever afters.This time it is Randy's turn, a quiet and unassuming giant of a man who is protective of his friends and sister, loves challenging himself by seeking adventure and puts a high value on living healthy. A good man, who is bothered by the fact that the woman he has more than a passing interest in seems to be afraid of him, when he poses absolutely no threat to her at all.The object of his focus, Willow, has come to the island a year ago, eager to escape into anonymity, for fear of being recognized and found, with good reason. She has kept to herself for the most part, but still has managed to make a few friends without having to share too much background information. She is simply seen as someone very private. Randy brings out feelings in her that slowly start making her feel safe enough to open up.Well-written and dripping with atmosphere, Terri Osburn creates a close-knit community where people still look out for each other. Where the entire town is invested in the happiness of one of its members. And where, once you have been adopted, you always have a home. As Willow finds out.&#10024;A captivating, spicy and heart-warming home-coming.&#10024;**Copy provided in return for an honest review.**",

    "reviewText": "In the character of Julia, Cathy Lamb has created a woman who is warm, funny, unique...and quite literally on the road to self-discovery. After leaving her abusive fiance at the altar in Boston (and her wedding veil on a gnarled tree in North Dakota), Julia keeps driving West until she gets to her aunt's house in Oregon. When she gets there, she meets a community full of quirky, offbeat characters, who show her what it means to support each other, value themselves and honor their passions. For Julia, that passion is expressed by the making of her chocolates. It's through her ability to be creative again, and to be in a place where she's surrounded by such fierce love, that Julia is finally able to deal with the dysfunction of her past and see that a very new kind of life is possible for her.One of the many things I loved about this story was the way the author built such distinct and heartbreakingly real characters. These were people who had experienced traumas both simple and complex and, yet, so often their way of dealing with the world was through their humor and through the power of their bonds with each other. As diverse as they are, the reader soon feels she *knows* these people--that they're so three-dimensional they just might walk off the page to greet us--and, to me, that's the mark of an incredibly talented author.Written beautifully with scenes that are, by turns, poignant, dramatic and hilarious, Julia's Chocolates is a novel I would highly recommend.",

    "reviewText": "To be honest, I picked up this book at a library sale but never had any intention of reading it. I love Bill Bryson and have read some of his other work but a book about his hiking the Appalachian Trail is something I would NEVER read! Strangely enough, I was bored one hot summer day and cracked it open only to find myself completely enthralled and racing through it as if it was a thriller. In other words, I loved it. So I supposed I have to say, Bryson may know my reading tastes better than myself!The book starts with Bryson getting the idea that he should walk the Appalachian Trail as a way to reacquaint himself with his homeland. For twenty years, he had lived with his wife and four children in England. In 1995, they all moved back to the states and settled in New Hampshire (Bryson and his family have since moved BACK to the UK). Always an avid lover of nature but never much of a hiker, Bryson decides he'll hike from the southern most spot on the AT (Appalachian Trail) to Mount Katahdin in Maine. As is usual with Bryson, he reads all about the subject and focuses a great deal on bear stories, deaths out on the trail, and the sordid history of the trail itself. He spends copious amounts of money on his gear and plans out an extremely optimistic hiking schedule. As the date gets closer, he worries about doing the journey on his own until his old childhood friend from Des Moines, Iowa calls and asks if he can come along. The two were hiking buddies years before and the experience had almost ruined their friendship, however, Bryson jumps at the thought of having company. Bryson chronicles their hiking and adds in chapters on the history of the trail, the history of the National Parks Service, even the history of some of the towns that they stop in. He really does a thorough job and in under 300 pages (for the paperback), it flies by!I have to say that I learned much more in this book than I ever thought possible. When the historic chapters came up, I often thought about skipping them but found myself just as engrossed as I was in the chapters detailing Katz and Bryson's odd couple-esque hiking trip. Bryson's reflections on the importance and significance of the AT in his life as well as in that of America is extremely well articulated. I have to say that it's the complete package! Bryson's humor always makes me chuckle but this book proves that he can also handle serious matters with great insight and understanding. It's excellent as far as I am concerned and certainly a read that anyone can enjoy (and how often can you say that about a book?!)",

I was constnatly amazed at the intracicies in the story, and the twists and turns that came with those intracicies.I'll avoid summarizing the plot because you can see that in other reviews and the book review. However, I will say that each chapter switches between narrators--Biso and Latha. Sometimes while reading, I would decide that I found one girl's story more intriguing than the other and I just wanted to skip to the next chapter to continue her story. Every time I had to fight that desire and just read the whole book in order. In doing so, I would become so intrugied with the next girl's story that I then didn't want *her* story to end...it was hard to read each chapter sequentially because I was so hungry to know what happened without so much suspense!If you like clever connections, twists and turns, and a bit of culture (the book is set in Sri Lanka), I would highly recommend this book. It's one that's easy to put down and come back to later, but it's so intriguing when you get far enough into it that you really don't want to do that at all :).",

The thing that really brings it home as opposed to other out of body death comments, is that, as a neurosurgeon, Dr Alexander later knew that his brain was not able to dream or be conscious after he came out of his coma. In other words, while he experienced his out of body death images, there was no way his brain could have produced them. His brain was shut down. It was an uplifting and scientific explanation for the ideas of an afterlife. It is a truly moving spiritual comment. I would recommend it to anyone; believer and non-believer.",

What is so interesting about Eben's book is his insistence, based on his experiences while he was in a coma, that the mind and consciousness is not dependent on the brain. Skeptics will still argue that his experiences arose from a recovering brain as he emerged from his coma. However, the vividness and profundity of these experiences do not correlate with a brain that has been badly damaged by meningitis. Further, the experiences suggest an afterlife that is even more real than the one we experience in this life. So, while humanity may build a non-biological intelligence that exceeds the abilities of the physical brain, it may still be missing that special ingredient that allows humans to go beyond life in a physical body.",

    "reviewText": "Usually chosing books on reviews, I was a bit apprehensive that I chose this book from the cover and inside blurb.  Twenty pages in I was relieved to know I made a wise choice as Cathy Lamb's book is rich in character, plot and resolution.Julia, abused her entire childhood, sickly chooses a cruel finance who continues the pattern with great zeal.  The day of the wedding, in a moment of clarity, Julia realizes she is making a huge mistake.  She escapes in her beat-up car from New England to Golden, Oregon to the comfort of her Aunt Lydia's farm, leaving her wedding dress dangling from a tree in North Dakota. At Aunt Lily's, Julia befriends 4 women who attend \"Aunt Lydia's Psychic Nights\" where each lady exposes her own set of disturbances.  The friendships open Julia's injured mind to understanding no one deserves constant berating, constant hitting, constant chaos.  But as she heals, her crazed fiance plots vicious revenge, and Julia knows a reckoning is coming.I found this beautifully written because in the face of disturbing subject matter there was still uproarious humor, gentle moments, quirky, loveable characters and redemption.  Written with a homespun prose, the book keeps you on a fragile edge, but doesn't leave you dangling for too long.  A perfect balance makes this a must read for all that hide from truth or are in search of it.Great first effort; I look forward to more books from this gifted author.",

But her life fell apart nine years ago when she witnessed a child, Amanda, being abducted from a parking lot and didn't question the man who said the girl was screaming because he wouldn't buy her a doll. Molly saw in her visions what happened to Amanda, and has lived with debilitating guilt since then--to the point of almost losing her sanity. To help her, Dr. Cole Tanner moved his wife and son from Philadelphia to a small town in Maryland.For ten years, the Tanners have been happy in their new home. Eric, the Tanner's son is in his first year of university, and Molly is active in the new community. She feels safe and accepted until Tracey Porter disappears from a playground. Guilt from the first abduction overwhelms Molly, but she is determined that this time she will speak out in time to save the child.As her visions surface, so does Cole's insistence that she let the police handle the crime. Molly knows Tracey is alive because visions reveal Tracey's fear and that she is being kept in a dark place. Molly's search uncovers old and new crimes and old and new secrets. Does she dare risk all? And can Molly help Tracey in time to save her?I don't give spoilers in my review, so I can't reveal the plot's intricacies. This book engaged me right away and kept me turning the pages. Ms Foster kept me guessing to the end of the book, then presented several surprise twists that united all the story's threads.

Much of my faith has been derived from experiences like the author's story, but not on a \"near death experience\" level.  I know that God is always with me and relish in his spirit when I feel him \"speaking\" to me on a level that I don't quite understand.It is obvious that Dr. Alexander is a very intelligent, accomplished neurosurgeon and I found the medical terminology somewhat difficult to grasp.  But that did not prevent me from understanding his story.He begins by describing the bacteria that attacked his body and the experiences while meeting God in heaven.  He describes it in as much detail as he can muster but finds that our language prevents him from describing it in full.  Next, he goes into details about what heaven and God are like - where love is a dominating force - and describes his physical, emotional and mental experiences.  Finally, he writes about his return to earth and how he ended up sharing his story with others.I would recommend this book for both believers and non-believers who are \"on the fence\" about whether there is a higher power.

    "reviewText": "This books potential readership falls into three categories:1. Those who are convinced there is an afterlife.2. Those who are convinced that life ends with the death of our body.3. Those who think there must be something beyond our material existence but have no experience on which to base this belief.Eben Alexd claims he wrote this book for those in category 3, in which I am included.Proof of Heaven confirms much of what William Bray discloses in Quantum Physics, Near Death Experiences, Eternal Consciousness, Religion, and the Human Soul, but there the resemblance ends. Bray's unfocused memoir is virtually impenetrable to anyone who isn't a physics scholar. If not for the monumentality of the subject matter I would have given up on it. In spite of the Bray's scientific credentials, the sloppiness of his writing casts a shadow on his credibility.Eben Alexander, on the other hand, has gone to the time and trouble of writing a book that is a pleasure, rather than a chore, to read. Proof of Heaven is clean, clear, precise, and credible. The author neatly balances the facts of his personal history and family background, with his \"adventure\" in the non-material world. For this reader, Proof of Heaven was a life altering experience. At 78 years of age, death has morphed from hypothetical to an imminent inevitability. It was therefore a comfort to be reassured by someone who has plunged into the abyss and survived to tell the tale. The message Eben Alexander delivers is a familiar one: 'Good News, God is Love.'True, his (admittedly inadequate) description of the afterlife (i.e. \"heaven\") is not entirely a pretty picture but anything is preferable to oblivion.

    "reviewText": "I usually like to let a story simmer a bit before writing a review, but this time I am making an exception because Chasing Amanda by Melissa Foster is exceptional. What a marvelous and uplifting story. The writing is superior to nearly all novels I have read, and the editing left few issues to trip over as I traversed the story.Molly is the Chasing Amanda heroine, a woman plagued by complacency guilt. Her \"gut\" told her to intervene in a potential child abduction eight years past, but she lacked faith in her own feelings and hard facts on which to act. After the child, Amanda, is murdered, Molly blames herself. Consumed by guilt, she becomes so depressed and dysfunctional that she nearly destroys her marriage and family. In an attempt to rebuild her life, she and her family re-locate to Boyds, MD. Over several years, she manages an incomplete and a shaky recovery, but is then confronted with a similar situation when another little girl, Tracy, is kidnapped. Once again, Moly is confronted with \"The Knowing\", paranormal visions that enable her to feel and \"see\" the terror experienced by the missing child. She vows not to fail Tracy, as she had Amanda, and is determined to follow the powerful seizure-like visions that grip her body when The Knowing overtakes her. The police and her husband believe she's losing her mind, but her son has faith in her ... and visions of his own.The writing is superb; the novel is spellbinding. I especially enjoyed the dialog between Moly and her son because Melissa Foster nailed it. The vernacular is current--the exact phrases and expressions one would expect from a young man. I also enjoyed the third person presentation that enabled me to know what each character was thinking. I could literally feel Tracy's terror as she was dropped into the \"bad spot\", a deep hole that her abductor covered with plywood and dirt as part of a behavior re-shaping program. That scene still makes me shudder.I will not give the plot away, but I will say two things about it. First, I had no idea who the perpetrator was until near the end of the story. I thought I did, a couple of times, but I was wrong. Somehow Melissa Foster managed to cast a cloak of suspicion over lots of innocent people. I did not feel intentionally misled, but I wouldn't want to play chess with Melissa Foster either. Second, the story is an emotional roller-coaster. If tears don't slip down your cheeks several times as you read Chasing Amanda, especially near the end, then you probably need professional help.Chasing Amanda has an intricate and well-developed plot, and the characters are so vivid they could be real. I give this book a strong five-star rating; I'm delighted to have read it.James L. HatchAuthor ofThe Substitute",

    "reviewText": "I finished this book yesterday and found it enjoyable. Dr. Eben Alexander, III recounts the story of his bout with bacterial meningitis, which put him into a coma for a week, during which time he had amazing NDEs. I was just as impressed by his full recovery as by what he reports from his NDEs. From what my son, an M.D., tells me (and Dr. Eben notes this as well), such an extended comatose experience ensuing from bacteria feeding on the brain usually results in a permanent vegetative state, or death. Yet just at the moment when they were about to terminate extraordinary life support, he popped back into consciousness. Amazing!The NDE is unusual in that he doesn't have much of a personal identity and is actually aware of such. He meets no family members nor anyone else he recognizes (at least at first; surprise ending about this part), but is nontheless &#34;dualistically&#34; engaged with &#34;others&#34; -- angelic orbs playing beautiful music, other humans, a beautiful female guide, and, of course, God, Whom he calls Om (from the sound surrounding the &#34;Core&#34; of all things). He absorbs deep truths non-conceptually and immediately, feels connected to all things, travels about by projecting himself via thoughts, and feels completely loved and accepted. It's not all pleasant, however, as he also comes into a dimension of &#34;muck&#34; that he calls Earthworm-eye view, an absorption into earthiness, but in a suffocating way. The gates of heaven open again and again to draw him out of this muck, which is &#34;alive,&#34; but somewhat eerie. Eventually, he is told he must return to his body and his life on earth, but has no idea what this means in the absence of personal identity. Once returned, however, he re-integrates with his life as a husband, father and neuro-surgeon.Dr. Eben's young adult son (in med school) is one of the first who is told about the NDE experiences, shortly after his dad returns, and he wisely suggests that his dad write out everything he could remember while it's still fresh and before he begins reading about NDEs and other spiritual literature. I think this lends even more credibility to what Dr. Eben reports.Much of the book is spent ranting about how close-minded the medical profession is concerning these kinds of experiences. Dr. Eben notes that he himself was once a reductionistic, scientific materialist, who believed that the brain generated consciousness -- that consciousness was an epiphenomenon which basically evaporated with brain death. Yet his own comatose experience, during which time his cerebral cortex was inactive, has convinced him now that consciousness is primary, with the body a means of expressing and developing it. This view is close to what most Christians would affirm.I had a couple of negative responses to the book, however. Dr. Eben seems so intent on &#34;proving&#34; that consciousness exists independently of the brain that he recommends James Monroe's Hemi-sync technology, which induces out-of-body experiences for many. He also likes it because it's not linked to any particular religious doctrine. Let the reader note, however, that OBEs do not always take one to heaven. Monroe himself fell among some pretty rough characters during some of his OBE forays. Heaven is filled with love and joy, but not all dimensions of reality outside the body are heavnely.Another &#34;problem,&#34; and one that most NDE people demonstrate, is that Dr. Eben seems to be convinced that his experience put him in touch with *THE TRUTH* about all sorts of metaphysical and theological issues. He doesn't critique religions much, and in fact seems to have found his way back to his own Christian roots, but the tendency to evaluate theology, philosophy and science in the light of his experience runs throughout the book. The problem is, here, that NDEs, taken as a whole, do not disclose a consistent message about the afterlife, if that's even what the phenomenon puts one in touch with at all.Still, his NDE, as so many others, turned out to be a spiritually transformative experience, encouraging him to examine literature that he had previously ignored. He seems to be a better man for it, though he'd best be careful about his crusading spirit against scientific materialism. The doctrinaire obstinacy he will find among such people will wear him out if he's not careful.",

Many of the reviews offer plot summaries, so I won't attempt the same, but I will say that, for me, the core of this novel is the imperfection and consequent heart-breaking misjudgments of the two protagonists.  Both Latha and Biso are complex, proud, and strong women, and their flaws are precisely what makes them real and compelling characters.  Human weakness--in all its manifestations--is a key theme in this story, and Freeman's novel is powerful precisely due to her unrelenting willingness to engage that universal trait and not shy away from it.  It is not a pretty book, though there is much beauty here, and these are not pretty characters.And if you're at all concerned that understanding Sri Lankan politics is necessary for understanding or enjoying this book, be assured that it is not.",

Quite a remarkable thing considering it was released such a short time ago. Dr. Alexander seems to a have touched upon an open wound in our collective consciousness. It's created quite a stir, and for good reason. The book is an outstanding achievement. It is at once, a thoroughly engaging memoir; an entertaining scientific exposition of NDE's; and a deeply moving account of one man's journey in unraveling one of Life's great mysteries ~ Consciouness itself.After all the 'Sound and Fury' surrounding this book settles down, it will inevitably endure as a timeless classic in its field. The sheer mastery of the literary form by Dr. Alexander to convey his experience in such a sincere, engaging, and emotionally powerful way, places his book head and shoulders above others of its kind. Moody himself, an icon in the field of NDEs, said it was the best book on the subject he'd ever read. After reading it yourself, I'm sure you'll understand why.As many have said, this book rings true on SO many levels that one feels as if Dr. Alexander has somehow stirred the embers of our own remembering. If you feel that you and I have similar interests; that we are perhaps even kindred spirits, and you find yourself on my 'Read All My Reviews' page, I can only say, from the deepest part of me ~ READ THIS BOOK!",

    "reviewText": "Gobbled this book right down because the author's near-death experience isn't the most amazing part---it was his perfect credentials for influencing everyone's opinion about that experience!I've visited places such as this neurosurgeon visited during his 7-day coma, and my nearly forty years of studying the *interdimensional* science of Consciousness made it all seem normal and to be expected of someone in his dying situation. What impressed and astonished and delighted me was how PERFECTLY his situation was designed to gain the attention of everyone who has NOT yet come to the awareness that consciousness does not begin or end with the physical brain!I highly, highly recommend this book. It's quick to read, because the story is so compelling, and the doctor/author has gone to great lengths to explain why this was NOT hallucination (that part of his brain was classified as completely nonfunctional at the time), or any other among a long list of conventional science's debunking explanations for NDEs. His unique experience refutes all of these arguments.The only flaw in the book isn't really a flaw: he can't yet explain how or why these things happened to him. Not to worry, Dr. Alexander! Others have and will. For instance, \"The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation\" by Ernest L. Norman offers complete, diagrammed, scientific explanations for the aspects of consciousness that bridge dimensions. This science fully explains how and why he experienced the visions and connections of his NDE, where he went, and perhaps even why he did so.As for why his deceased father didn't come to greet him during his other-side visit--that, too, can be explained. It's in my books, it's in E.L. Norman's books, and one day I'm sure the author will understand, as well.Because of my already-established beliefs, I'd stopped reading about near-death experiences, but I will be recommending this book to everyone who'll listen!",

I want to go home!\" She clawed at the dirt, kicking fiercely at her captor's face, \"I'm not going back in there!\" Tracey felt her arm being pulled and twisted behind her back. Her terrified screams were absorbed by the dirt walls of the tunnel.Chasing AmandaBy Melissa FosterMelissa Foster hooked me from the first page and I stayed there reading until I finished it that evening! If you have the time, I'd recommend you plan to do the same...because Foster's second book is full of suspense, intrigue and a story that grabs you and holds on tight until you've read the final words! The subject matter is horrendous, of course, but I find that well-written novels with a tremendous impact, also serve to make more and more people aware of how easily, how very easily it is...to lose your child...Molly, our lead character, had not only found that out, but had been traumatized by what she had seen. Amanda, a little girl had been abducted. Molly had seen her screaming and struggling with a man she thought was the father who had calmly told Molly she was upset about not getting her doll. Molly had driven away but later discovered that the girl had been abducted and later found murdered. Although years had passed, Molly had never forgotten, or forgiven herself. She had sunk so far into depression that her husband decided to relocate the family...But little girls alone are not safe, no matter where you go...Now, in Boyds, a little girl was missing. Her name was Tracey... And Molly was adamant she was going to do everything possible to help find her, even if it meant losing her husband...Besides, she was tortured by visions of little Tracey. \"She called the powerful episodes the Knowing, as her mother had. Now, she'd give anything to be able to close her eyes against her ability, wash it away like dirt from a fall. Before Amanda, Molly's visions had been vague and sporadic, sand under a breaking wave, morphing from one second to the next in unclear shapes and patterns. Amanda's death had changed every aspect of her life, including the clarity and frequency of her visions...\"While Boyds was a quiet small town where Molly had become involved and gotten to know most of the members of the community, she found that people were not happy that she was diligently working to find Tracey. Asking questions had led to the fact that another little girl had disappeared there 20 years ago and never been found. Secrets of small towns may disrupt an entire community and the person asking questions may be in danger...\"No! Not now! She closed her eyes and tried to will away the pressure in her head. There was no escape. She clenched her fists and brought them to her forehead, bracing herself for what she knew was happening. A fog enveloped her mind, and her legs became weak beneath her. A passerby, seeing her body shake and thrust, would have thought Molly was having a seizure. A passerby wouldn't have been able to distinguish between a seizure and the Knowing. Molly could...She felt like a puppet on a string. Visions flashed in her mind: A cavern-like room surrounded by shadowy darkness; a young girl huddled in a corner, scared and shivering; the smell of rancid, wet earth. Molly fell to the ground and cried out in fear and frustration, \"No!\"The police wouldn't support her; her husband didn't want her to become so involved. The one woman, her pastor, who had helped her through many discussions when she had first arrived, now seemed distant, secretive, and Molly had even seen her out in the night in strange places. But she wasn't the only one--another friend who had been out searching had stopped strangely in the middle of a cornfield and touched the ground, saw Molly and moved on. When Molly reached the spot, she bent down and \"felt\" that something was there...But time was passing and Tracey had still not been found. Molly was finding clues, but kept them to herself, hoping that they would bring psychic connections...but when they did, nobody would go with her to the place where she knew Tracey was being held... Now she faced Tracey's abductor, and found that Tracey had been so traumatized that she no longer wanted to leave the one who had kidnapped her...You DO NOT want to miss this one! I considered this a must-read...for many reasons! Readers--you know who you are! Melissa Foster is a true storyteller, able to create strong believable characters, provide riveting suspense, and, at the same time, spotlight the major issue of child abduction. Melissa, very well done!Book Received ViaFacebook Reviewers RoundupGABixlerReviews",

Dr. Eben Alexander's near-death experience is the most astounding I have read in my decades of reading and studying this phenomenon.Dr. Alexander brings a very special view to the spiritual realm due to his education and vocation in the medical world.  His combination of science and the spiritual is profound and believable.  Proof of Heaven is a compelling story of our future as we move from this life into the next dimension.  My only fear is that the scientific community will continue to ignore the spiritual element that governs this place we call the universe.  Hopefully, Dr. Alexander's persuasive and undeniable story will convince our skeptics to take a long, serious look at this arena.I also enjoyed the story within the story about his struggles with adoption and the captivating tale of despair and eventually fulfillment.  This story was forceful for me as I have a daughter struggling with the same issues.  I hope she can find peace as Dr. Alexander has done.I highly recommend this book.

    "reviewText": "When Bill Bryson returned to the United States after living in Britain for twenty years, he decided to reacquaint himself with his home country in a rather unique way. He would hike the Appalachian Trail. The AT, in hiker lingo, opened in 1937 and snakes 2,100 miles across 14 states, from Georgia to Maine. Nor did he go it alone; Stephen Katz, a colorful childhood friend from Iowa whom he had barely seen in 25 years, joined him. Both hikers were grossly out of shape as they approached their mid-life venture, and neither knew the least thing about hiking and camping. Bryson is a brilliant writer and a comic genius, and in his hands their many AT experiences spring to life--from buying their equipment, to obsessing about bear attacks, through rain and snow, filth and mud, and encounters with oddballs and eccentrics they met along the trail. Interspersed among the comic narrative, Bryson alternates with the history, topography and geography of the AT. As I prepared to hike the comparatively short John Muir Trail in California, a mere 200 miles, a friend who knew that I was a rookie recommended that I read this book. Bryson's Walk enjoyed a run on the bestseller list of the New York Times a few years ago, and I found myself resonating with one reviewer who compared Bryson to a combination of John Muir and Dave Berry. The AT is a hike of five million steps, says Bryson, but you can enjoy this wonderful book without ever leaving the house.",

    "reviewText": "Quite honestly, I couldn't put this book down. I just loved it! The author, Bill Bryson, does a superb job in describing the Appalachians. Upon finishing reading this book, I ordered books from amazon.com on the Appalachian Trail. You guessed it: my next adventure will be to hike the Trail.Not many books succeed in motivating you to leave your coach and explore the beautiful world around you. If you are a hiker, A Walk in the Woods might just be the best book you will read this year! However, a word of caution: Do not read it at bedtime; your heart will beat so fast from excitement you'll lose sleep.The story is about the author and his friend Stephen Katz, a hilarious character, deciding to hike the whole 2100 miles or so of the Appalachian Trail. They end up hiking half of it (just less than 900 miles), deciding that they are not cut out for this; still, quite an achievement.The author narrates the history of the Appalachian Trail; statistics on how many hikers succeed or fail in hiking the whole trail; bear attack statistics (only 9 bear attacks in the last few decades); fatal and non-fatal diseases one can get hiking the Trail (some are horrific and probably you never heard of them or expected to be present in your backyard); snake bites (apparently none were fatal); murder on the trail (the Trail is not immune from murderers, and there was a murder committed at the time the author was hiking the Trail); and most importantly, loads of laughter!Read this book; you'll be glad you did.",

I am a Christian and I have always believed in Life after Death so that was my primary reason for wanting to read this book which has been recommended by so many reviewers and critics. If you are not a person of Faith then this book may not change that because even this book is still Faith based. Dr. Eben Alexander is an accomplished Neurosurgeon who is the author and the subject of this book. The journey recounts the brief After Life journey taken by Dr. Alexander while his mortal body remained on Earth in a hospital attended by family, colleagues and friends struggling to survive. The actual After Life journey by the spirit of Dr. Alexander is something that you will richly enjoy if you are a person of Faith so I will not spoil that here. Buy this book and read about the journey. If you are a person of Faith it will be worth it. The terminology is Medical Level at times because Dr. Alexander is a Neurosurgeon but, it fits well with the book. Since the return of the Spirit of Dr. Alexander to his Earthly body he has chosen a new mission in Life; to spread The Word about The After Life!",

A lot of wise things that rang true to me.I am no longer surprised when after finding a wonderful book, I then see a lot of doubters and haters  of it in the Amazon reviews.

Just ignore their negativity and close-mindedness and read this book anyway.This book gives every indication to me that the author is sincere and is genuinely trying to share something valuable with the world. I found what he said to be valuable.His explanations about the meaning and purpose of life are pretty closely aligned with what I believe as a Mormon, even though some of the specifics of what he saw sound a bit strange. But I'm prepared to believe it's a big universe to experience and try to comprehend \"on the other side.\"I thank the author for having the courage and honesty to write this book.As with all these NDE books, there is a lot about the illness, the author's background, etc. I always skip over that and just read the actual NDE account. However, this book also includes many chapters where the author analyzes and tries to synthesize what he learned - those chapters were also great.If you liked this book, also check outReturn from Tomorrow.",

This story allows the reader to almost become the Queen herself as she struggles to survive her controling father and the manipulative factions that work with in the monarchy. She shares her feelings and deepest desires for self love and independence after being labled a bastard. She lights on her affection for Thomas Seymour and her sister Mary's tumultuous reign. She wows in her love for Lord Robert Dudley and longing for children of her own all the while devoting herself entirely to people and country.I have seen many films, both biographical and hollywood cinema like that portray the Queen as a strong, intellectual, high spirited, passionate woman and leader who still finds time to pursue important matters close to her heart. Miles does a supurb job of showing Elizabeth I's life, loves and struggles of being a queen in a very controversial time in England's history",

This is similar to a trusted friend/financial advisor giving you inside information.  You have to take it seriously.We probably all hope that there is something after we die.  Some look to religion, some look to nature.  This writer is convinced that there is an afterlife, as he has been there and seen it personally.  He takes a lot of time to explain why his experience cannot be attributed to brain function or malfunction. He truly became convinced that there is something good waiting for us after we die.The book is easy to read in some parts and quite technical in other parts.  I have a medical background so I understood most of it but some parts were well beyond my understanding.  Also, while he mentions his religious background, he makes his arguments on non-religious basis.It is a good read and provides a lot of hope to his fellow humans.",

All this, mind you, carrying a forty-pound pack. (Have you hoisted a forty-pound pack lately, let alone try to walk with it?) And all earthly needs, on such a walk, must come from this pack on your back. I daresay few of us have the strength or fortitude to carry out this kind of venture, particularly, as Bryson did, in part, with snow on the ground.In 1996 that's what Bryson and his friend Stephen Katz did and Bryson made it into a 274-page story that is \"choke on your coffee funny\" as one reviewer put it. For example: \"I wanted to get back on the trail, to knock off some miles. It is what we did. Besides, I was bored to the point somewhat beyond being bored out of my mind. I was reading restaurant place mats, then turning them over to see if there was anything on the back. At the lumberyard, I talked to workmen through the fence. Late on the third afternoon, I stood in a Burger King and studied, with absorption, the photographs of the manager and his executive crew (reflecting on the curious fact that people who go into hamburger management always look as if their mother slept with Goofy), then slid one place to the right to examine the Employee of the Month awards. I then realized I had to get out of Franklin.\"Not only is Mr. Bryson's tale excruciatingly funny, he is an astute observer who lays out powerful insights on how modern mankind is wantonly destroying nature at an alarming pace. He captivates you with penetrating wit, yet at the same time, makes it crystal clear that if we keep tearing nature down at our present frantic pace, there soon won't be any nature with the result that, indeed, there may not be any of \"us.\"",

Some believe that it's a way for your brain to protect you during death. I choose too believe that it is so much more. I am happy to see a book by a neurosurgeon who experienced it first hand and gives a very cogent and educated analysis of his experience.  The appendixes, written by colleagues who cared for him during his coma, along with his personal research which attempts to prove that NDE's are real,(a concept that he didn't believe in until experiencing it) gives credibility to the many people who have had NDEs.  For me, it was a picture of hope that one day everyone will understand that everything and everyone in our universe is connected. My hope is that as the subject is studied more in depth,we will evolve to a more peaceful, loving, life experience, facing death as the next new adventure rather than just an ending.",

    "reviewText": "The bears out there\"Into the Woods\" captures perfectly the stupefying/frightening/exhilarating experience of tramping through the forests of the East Coast. Bryson brings his trademark wit and intelligence to bear on his experience of (partly) hiking the Appalachian trail -- the 2500-some-odd mile long footpath from Georgia to Maine. Bryson is accompanied by his friend, Steve Katz, who provides the perfect foil to Bryson's attempts at good trail sense. Bryson is comically unprepared, and foolishly cavalier about trail etiquette. He throws away important items and wanders off without map or compass, not that he could read them anyway. Sometime, I thought that if Katz didn't exist, Bryson would have had to invent him. And perhaps he did. But Bryson's friend provided the drama that a long walk in the woods might not otherwise enjoy.Bryson used the book as an excuse to talk about all sort of subjects related to the great outdoors. He tells of the glaciers, extreme weather and human dreams that shaped the trail. He terrifies us with stories of bear attacks, cougar sightings and hypothermia. He enrages us with tales of the ineptitude of the US Park Service and the US Corps of Engineers. He saddens with stories of Centralia, PA, a town which literally sits above a fire pit. Then there's the disappearance of much of the tree cover that dominated the America forests not so many years ago: so many chestnuts and elms lost to fungi and other diseases. But his stories about fellow hikers are often hilarious - especially one poor, unprepared young lady who spent her time questioning other hikers about their choice of gear - \"Big mistake!\" has her byword. But Bryson always enchants with his description of the vastness, wildness and ruggedness of the forest. He makes us appreciate its innate loveliness, as well as the people who make it their life's goal to preserve it and make it available to others. His description of the breathtaking beauty and incredible fickleness of my beloved White Mountains had me enthralled.\"A Walk in the Woods\" is not the definitive book on the twists and turns of the Appalachian Trail. For that, refer to one of the many guides about the trail and its topography. But it is a must-read for those who love the outdoors -- and for the occasional hiker, who can stand to be made wary of the perils of tramping unprepared.",

Although deeply spiritual the author didn't try throwing his own religious nonsense or beliefs in there like so many NDR's seem to do. That is a huge turnoff for me and one that makes me feel that those claiming to have the experience are either coloring it too much with their own beliefs or flat out lying. The author was able to explain much of his experience in a way that I could fully understand and in basic terms. Although he gave us alot of medical background he admits that science alone has no answer for the divine. I highly recommend this book if you aren't looking for someone to shove Jesus or religion or the bible down your throat.",

From the first fifteen pages that I read sitting on a stool in the bookstore, I saw that Bryson was able to write with an astuteness that made me want to never put the book down. He was able to slice through and get to the humor or meaning behind any event. I originally picked up this book because I was interested in the subject and the back cover advertised how funny it was. However, this book is much more than funny. In addition to his wit, Bryson is incredibly thoughtful and well researched. In between descriptions of his own hike, Bryson discusses the history of the trail, and the condition of plants, animals, and anything else he runs into. He was no expert hiker, and his story is relatable. From the beginning, he was able to get himself into ridiculous situations, though perhaps some of this is the fact that Bryson could make the most mundane experience interesting. I normally try to point out some of the weaker points in a book, but I liked this book too much to find anything worth mentioning. Well, I'm off to go hiking.",

Isn't that what all life is really about?I have been an avid Birder for many years and have often crossed a somewhat similar trail here in Ontario,and have even walked along some short parts of it while birding .It is called \"The Bruce Trail and starts at Niagara Falls and runs to the tip of the Bruce Peninsula,over 200 miles ,as the crow lies,ending in Tobermory at Lake Huron.\" When I see the markings on the trees and when I come across the record book stands or meet hikers,I feel the \"sense\" of the trail and even contempleted \"giving it a try\";but probably never will;and have to be contented with my minimal samplings of it ;not unlike the sampling of birding that the hikers get.After all,nobody can do everything ,that doesn't mean you can't sample everything you come across.I have seen nearly 600 different species of birds in North America and in those travels have encounteres much history,enviroments,weather,and people along the way.There are still more of them to see,but so be it;the real enjoyment is in what I have done;not what I still have to see.I am often reminded of what Roger Tory Peterson,one of America's most famous Birders said ,when asked ;\"What was your favorite bird?\" His reply was \"The one I'm looking at ,at the time.\"I fully agree with Bryson when he says \"We hiked the Appalachian Trail\".Some people who enjoy other pursuits can say the same about what they have done,and in whatever manner they did it.Whether it's sports,fishing,mountain climbing,playing poker or pool,those who do those things generally enjoy the experiences and people that surround them as much as the activity itself.That,I believe,is what Bryson has brought out so well in this book.",

I just had to get that out of the way ;)I really liked how the book was divided into four parts; each girl had her own section, and that section was only about that particular Liar.Hanna's story, I thought, was very amusing. Her BF leaves her to go on vacay, and she feels all alone, especially since her dad, stepmother, and Kate move into her house. She meets this cute guy who she may or may not be falling for, and, lets just say that Hanna isn't the only one drooling over this dude. Oh, and Kate is a total witch! Can't believe Hanna has to put up with her!I really liked Emily's story too. There have been pranksters in Rosewood causing havoc in the town. And somehow Emily winds up trying to catch these \"Merry Elves\" in the act to finally stop all the holiday disasters. How is she going to do this? you ask. Easy: by befriending them, duh.Oh my gods, Aria's story was....crazy! Seriously crazy and shocking! That is the only way I can describe it. Aria's was supposed to spend the holidays with her dad and brother, but something totally uncool changed things. Upon arriving home, Aria gets an unexpected visit from her ex-BF from Iceland. And from there things get crazy! I wish I could say, but I don't want to spoil things! Let's just say it involves panthers, weddings, and delinquents! You seriously have got to read this one!Spencer goes on vacation with her family to Florida. Here she meet a really cute guy, he seems to be interested in her. But, again, she might not be the only one. Oddly enough, Melissa helps Spencer get the guy! Oh, the things they do when they work together...that revenge they pulled off at the end, for example. Oh my gods, it was hilarious!This book was seriously awesome, and totally creepy...you know, because of A. Throughout the whole book I kept wondering if A was the same A we discovered on the show in this summer season finally. If it is, then it makes no sense at all!But anyway, I cannot wait for more of this series...both the books AND the show!",

The fact that a neurosurgeon, of finely tuned and solid scientific bent, was the individual who found himself having a NDE (near-death experience) is beyond coincidence. Heaven chose the perfect spokesperson! Dr. Alexander writes from the heart, which makes his book so readable, but he also includes some of his own scientific observations, which may be helpful to those with a more skeptical mindset. I loved reading all of it, and I especially appreciated the way the book was organized, with chapters describing his own other-worldly experience alternating with chapters describing the experiences of his family members who sat by his side while he was in a coma. This is NOT a dry factual narrative--the beauty of his thoughts, feelings, and perceptions brought me to tears at times. A beautiful uplifting book!--Peggy Korneggerauthor of Living with Spirit",

Each of the major characters in the story has enormous challenges to meet, and with each others help they manage to survive, even triumph, in spite of a few truly foolish decisions.  The only criticism I'd make is that the men aren't explored as thoroughly as the women -- their challenges are in the past, referred to but not shown, which makes them more spear-carriers than developing characters -- and they're great guys, and would have been interesting.  The monsters are truly monstrous, also, without any desire or intent to do the right thing, ever.  That said, I loved this book, curled up and read it for hours, finishing it at 2 a.m. And I had to get up at 5:30.  It's that good.",

In QM, this is known as \"the observables problem\".\"Proof of Heaven\" by Eben Alexander, M.D., is the most scientifically well documented presentation of an NDE (Near Death Experience) I've ever heard of, and there are 10's of thousands of NDE's carefully recorded and itemized in academic compendia.  These include irreproachable reports from young children but which are, perforce, less scientifically well grounded than this one from a noted neurosurgeon.Coming from a standpoint other than quantum theory, viz. from his personal experience,  Alexander's insights into the interrelationships between body, mind, consciousness, and spirit (or soul), and what they tell us about reality, are extremely interesting.Martin Fricke, Ph.D.San Diego",

But something tells me that it was more the need to know what it feels like to know that the firearm you hold in your hand has one job. Kill.To get inside the #1 sniper of the United States and see or learn what it must be like to take aim at someone whom you do not know, someone who has a mother who carried him/her to term, breastfed, laughed and nurtured whom you know seek to put a bullet in that persons heart or head is jaw dropping surreal. And something I think the American citizen needs to know!In my opinion most Americans don't give much thought to what their tax dollars are paying for in the military or sadly, the underpaid, men women we send off to far off lands to do our bidding and sadly killing. But men like Jack Coughlin do what most Americans couldn't do even if threatened face to face.  It sounds so odd calling him a hero, but to me he is. War is hell and good all American men/women are doing the job well.",

I passed it onto my son who is an even more addicted reader than I am and he read this book so many times the pages fell out of it.  I have given this book to friends who loved it.  It surprises me that anyone would rate this book in a negative way.  I did not feel that the humor was at anybody's expense.  I remember a couple of years after reading this book I happened to be in the Blue Ridge mountains.  I had stopped at a ranger station to pick up some maps and information.  I started talking to one of the rangers there and I mentioned this book.  As soon as I said it he started laughing and so did I.  It's a fun book and I would recommend it to anybody.",

Tightly written and wonderfully descriptive, A Walk in the Woods is the story of Bill and his sidekick Stephan Katz.  These two are not your typical outdoorsman but two relatively sedentary middle-aged men who undertake one of the most challenging hikes on the continent armed with little more than a backpack full of Little Debbie cakes (soon abandoned)and the vague notion of hiking the two-thousand odd miles of the trail in one season.It's not spoiling the story to tell you they don't even come close to meeting that goal, but the story is so rich and so fun it helps demonstrate that the joy is really in the journey, not the destination.I loved this book for its honest and direct tone and the way Bryson kept me laughing from page one.

The information on the trail is great alone, even without the humorous observations. So what if he didn't pan out as a thru-hiker, the book is still a interesting read and inspiring to those who dream of hiking the trail. I think he deserves respect for increasing interest in hiking the trail. Now maybe it won't fall into ruin and be forgotten like other american treasures.",

After all, as a neurosurgeon, Dr. Alexander would have a far better grasp on how the brain works, especially under the dire circumstances that he found himself, than the average lay person and he is not so easily dismissed.My impression is that for all his years of academic research, study and practice, he struggled to describe exactly what he experienced as there are no sufficient words that could do it justice.  The fact that on his return to this life, he looked closely at other possible scenarios as to what could have caused such an experience, shows that he was not quick to jump on the NDE bandwagon as some have asserted, but rather wanted to make sure that there was really no other materialist explanation that made any sense.I've read several of the critics comments who demand that he provide 'proof' that he had this experience while in a deep coma as they insist that he had it while on the road to recovery.  Of course, they cannot prove that either but expect everyone to accept their view without question.My only criticism of the book is the title.  While I believe his account is very strong evidence that something does indeed survive the physical death, it is not 100% proof, at least by human standards.  Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it.",

    "reviewText": "This book goes where others fear to tread.  Most of the simple living, decluttering books stop short of confronting the main tenet of this book:  how much do we really need to live \"rich\" lives?  The answer Lawrence gives us with candid examples is, 'very little!'  I love this book because it opens my mind to consider American life in radical ways, and because he gives concrete examples of how to do it.  Yes, the book is short (minimal:proves the point!) and, yes, because it's self-published there might be a few typos and Lawrence doesn't have the advantage of Madison Avenue's best and brightest editors.  Reviewers who focus on this are missing the point: someone has broken ranks with convention to share his insights with us and they're extremely valuable.Mr. Lawrence was born in Singapore and he had a successful career with HP in the states after moving here.  He was able to retire in his 40s due to his frugality.  Lawrence's perspective gives us the insight and impetus to examine our own lives.  This is one of the few books I bought and kept; I refer to it regularly.One reviewer compared Lawrence's lifestyle to living under a bridge.  Far from it!  Lawrence lives in one of the wealthiest communities on the planet with a five-star view from his condo living room.  And he can move easily within the continent in a compact sedan car.  Lawrence eats well, dresses well, gives back through volunteering, has good friends and, as he shares, peace of mind.This is an author I wish I could meet, and I hope he will write more.  I'd love to read about a day in his life, see a video on youtube that shows his home and neighborhood and grocery shopping, hear what he is reading.  Lawrence is a very bright, walks-his-talk, likable, progressive person and I appreciate the opportunity to \"meet him\" through this great book.",

She knows an \"inconvenienced\" Robert eventually will come for her once he obtains Aunt Lydia's address from her mom hidden in Minnesota with her zillionth boyfriend, but Lydia will not go with him.Lydia welcomes her beloved niece and offers sanctuary while Julia tries to recoup her lost optimism.  Lydia's warm friends also greet Julia as one of them.  She and her circle of friends welcome Julia into their lives.  As Julia begins to feel better about herself and her future, she makes friends and chocolate.From the opening line of leaving her wedding dress on a tree in North Dakota to the climax, JULIA'S CHOCOLATES is a strong character study looking deep at a woman trying desperately to regain the hope she once had about life.  The supporting females like Aunt Lydia and her friends add depth to the audience comprehending the demons eroding Julia's dreams.  Contemporary fiction fans will appreciate this fine portrayal just go easy on the chocolates.Harriet Klausner",

I have read many YA novels that have overwhelmed me with their value as a book to treasure and read over and over again. A Wounded Name is most definitely one of them. Hamlet has long been a favorite of mine. I've seen professional and not-so-professional productions, and each one held a particular fascination for me, especially through the interpretation of the character, Ophelia.A Wounded Name is a retelling of the tragedy, Hamlet, seen primarily through the eyes of Ophelia. The author does not miss a beat with this story -- Ophelia has been brought to life in full bloom, to my delight. If you enjoy excellent writing from an author who thoroughly knows her characters and presents them without fear of violating a politically correct view of a heroine, this book is most definitely one that will satisfy on many levels. Recommended for both adults and older teens.",

Not only did I get to enjoy a good story (two stories), but also had the opportunity to learn some history of Sri Lanka and how various people lived there. I don't want to get into any more detail for fear of giving something away.This would make a great Book Club selection.

Like what happened to Rodney Letts and what secrets the minister held inside her.  What made the Boyd house so secretive that no one was allowed in.  What secrets Hannah held close to her chest.  And who took Tracey and what happened so many years ago with Kate another kidnapped victim and did Rodney hold the secrets or was he to blame.  I applaud how Molly was able to percever when she had doubts when she witnessed a girl go missing and turned up dead.  The woman who took Tracey somewhere deep down thought she was doing what she was taught.  She had very much a Stockholm syndrome going on, which brought her to her own turmoil.  Molly and Cole suffer their own issues wishing they could have done more for Amanda and in some ways I believe that is what made this book so captivating.  Tracey has no connection to Molly but yet Molly is so determined to help her, I think it was in a way someone she could help when she felt her \"knowing\" failed her when she needed it the most.  Rodney and Molly even have an interesting connection both being born with abilities to know what is happening to someone else.  The two abilities connected together help prove that sometimes psychics know what they are doing.  A great story full of so much love and admiration towards family that I can't wait to read Megan's Way.",

I considered that the book could be written primarily for financial gain, but then I thought, well, he is a Neurosurgeon and his income has to be in the upper stratosphere, so money would not be a number one reason .  His story is fascinating and his recovery equally fascinating.  I believe that I was just hearing that in August 2013 , a skeptical story is going to be published that questions the good doctor.  That will be interesting to read .  Questioning anything is always good.  But the story is riveting and the circumstances of his health at the time were dire.  He has changed his life to tell his story.  He believes that what happened is true. The reader can decide !",

This book should be read  especially by scientifically oriented individuals in the medical profession who tend to try to come up with explanations of how such an experience might occur as a sort of hallucination.  It is especially pertinent for people in the medical profession who are around people who are considered to be terminal or who have survived a serious illness and talk about their experiences.",

Although the doctor does speak some medical jargon which some people won't completely understand, it still is easy to get the whole picture.  I am convinced he was on the other side in heaven and paints heaven as a beautiful peaceful place indescribable in human language. He saw &#34;dogs&#34; in heaven..&#34;happy&#34; dogs.

    "reviewText": "By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.comWith more than 6,000 reviews of the book \"Proof of Heaven\" in such a shot time, I don't think it is an exaggeration to say that it is the most desired subject of the century. It is a daunting task for one such as I \"of very small brain\" as Winnie the Poo put it, to even think of writing a review that anyone would find in an amazon.com search except for those who \"See all of my reviews.\" I therefore differ to Mike Adams review that I think is the best review that has been given. It has value for non-readers because they will get the message of the book without reading it.\"Proof of Heaven' documents existence of afterlife, multiverse, intelligent life beyond Earth, multidimensional realities\" by Mike Adams(NaturalNews) \"There's a secret that's much bigger than politics, health freedom, science or even the entire history of the human race. That secret remains entirely unacknowledged -- even condemned -- by the scientific community, and yet it is the single most important secret about everything that is. Yes, everything.That secret is simply this: We all survive the physical death of our bodies. Our consciousness lives on, and upon our death in this Earthly dream, our consciousness transcends this physical reality and experiences an existence so amazing and powerful that the human language cannot even begin to describe it.This is the message from Dr. Eben Alexander, author of the newly-published book, \"Proof of Heaven.\" I recently read the book and found it both fascinating and also confirming of several important theories I've been developing about the nature of life and the Creator. (See below.)A lifelong science skeptic who never believed in God, Heaven or consciousnessLong before this book was ever written, Dr. Alexander was a practicing neurosurgeon and a lifelong \"science skeptic.\" He did not believe in consciousness, free will or the existence of a non-physical spirit. Trained in western medical school and surrounded by medical colleagues who are deeply invested in the materialism view of the universe, Dr. Alexander believed that so-called \"consciousness\" was only an illusion created by the biochemical functioning of the brain.This is a view held by virtually all of today's mainstream scientists, including physicists like Stephen Hawking who say that human beings are nothing more than \"biological robots\" with no consciousness and no free will.Dr. Alexander would have held this view to his own death bed had it not been for his experiencing an event so bizarre and miraculous that it defies all conventional scientific explanation: Dr. Alexander \"died\" for seven days and experienced a vivid journey into the afterlife. He then returned to his physical body, experienced a miraculous healing, and went on to write the book \"Proof of Heaven.\"E.coli infection eats his brainIt all started when e.coli bacteria infected Dr. Alexander's spinal fluid and outer cerebrum. The e.coli began to literally eat his brain away, and he went into an extremely violent fit of seizures, verbal outbursts and muscular spasms before lapsing into a brain-dead coma.In this coma, he showed zero higher brain activity and was only kept alive via a respirator and IV fluids. The attending physicians soon concluded that Dr. Alexander would die within a matter of days, and that even if he lived, he would be a non-functioning \"vegetable\" with limited brain function. Statistically, the death rate for patients with e.coli infections of the brain is 97%.But here's the real shocker in all this: Rather than experiencing nothingness during these seven earth-days of unconsciousness, Dr. Alexander found himself \"awakening\" from the dream of his earthly life, suddenly experiencing an incomprehensibly vast expansion of his consciousness in the afterlife.This experience is described in more detail in his book \"Proof of Heaven,\" but here are the highlights:* The experience of the afterlife was so \"real\" and expansive that the experience of living as a human on Earth seemed like an artificial dream by comparison.* There was no time dimension in the afterlife. Time did not \"flow\" as it does in our universe. An instant could seem like eternity, and consciousness could move through what we perceive to be time without effort. (This idea that all time exists simultaneously has enormous implications in understanding the nature of free will and the multiverse, along with the apparent flow of time experienced by our consciousness in this realm.)* The fabric of the afterlife was pure LOVE. Love dominated the afterlife to such a huge degree that the overall presence of evil was infinitesimally small.* In the afterlife, all communication was telepathic. There was no need for spoken words, nor even any separation between the self and everything else happening around you.* The moment you asked a question in your mind, the answers were immediately apparent in breathtaking depth and detail. There was no \"unknown\" and the mere asking of a question was instantly accompanied by the appearance of its answers.* There also exists a literal Hell, which was described by Dr. Alexander as a place buried underground, with gnarled tree roots and demonic faces and never-ending torment. Dr. Alexander was rescued from this place by angelic beings and transported to Heaven.God acknowledges the existence of the multiverseThe passage of \"Proof of Heaven\" I found most interesting is found on page 48, where Dr. Alexander says:Through the Orb, [God] told me that there is not one universe but many -- in fact, more than I could conceive -- but that love lay at the center of them all. Evil was present in all the other universes as well, but only in the tiniest trace amounts. Evil was necessary because without it free will was impossible, and without free will there could be no growth -- no forward movement, no chance for us to become what God longed for us to be. Horrible and all-powerful as evil sometimes seemed to be in a world like ours, in the larger picture love was overwhelmingly dominant, and it would ultimately be triumphant.This passage struck an important cord with me, as I have long believed our universe was created by the Creator as just one of an infinite number of other universes, each with variations on life and the laws of physics. (Click here to read my writings on the Higgs Boson particle, consciousness and the multiverse.) What Dr. Alexander's quote confirms is that our life on planet Earth is a \"test\" of personal growth, and that the way to make progress in this test is to overcome evil while spreading love and compassion.Even more, this passage also confirms the existence of free will and even helps answer the question I'm often asking myself: \"Why are we placed here in a world of such evil and surrounded by ignorance, darkness and deception?\" The answer appears to be that Earth is a testing ground for souls that have been selected by the Creator for the ultimate test of good versus evil.Earth as a testing groundAlthough \"Proof of Heaven\" doesn't go as far as I'm explaining here, my working theory is that our planet Earth is among the highest evil-infested realms in the grand multiverse. Only the most courageous souls agree to come to Earth by being born into human bodies and stripped of their memories.From there, the challenge of life is multi-faceted:1) Figure out WHO you are and WHY you are here.2) Learn to recognize and overcome EVIL (tyranny, slavery, oppression, Big Government, etc.).3) Learn to spread love, compassion, healing and knowledge.Upon our death, we are judged by a higher power, and that judgment takes into account our performance in these areas. Did we achieve a measure of self-awareness? Did we work to overcome evil? Did we express love and compassion and help uplift others with knowledge and awareness?As you've probably already figured out, the vast majority of humans fail these tests. They die as bitter, selfish, substance-addicted, greed-driven minions of evil who mistakenly thought they were winning the game of life while, in reality, they were losing the far more important test of the Creator.The most important part about living a human life is not acquiring money, or fame, or power over others but rather achieving a high \"score\" in this simulation known as \"life\" by resisting evil, spreading love and expanding awareness of that which is true.For those who respect life, who practice humility and self awareness, who seek to spread knowledge and wisdom while resisting tyranny, oppression, ignorance and evil, their souls will, I believe, be selected for special tasks in the greater multiverse. That's the \"real\" existence. This Earthly life is only a dream-like simulation where your soul interfaces with the crude biology of our planet for a very short time span that's actually the blink of an eye in the larger picture.In reality, you are much more than your body. In fact, your soul is infinitely more aware, intelligent and creative than what can be experienced or expressed through the brain of a human. Trying to experience the full reality of what you are through the limited physical brain matter of a human being is a lot like trying to teach an insect to compose music like Mozart.The multiverse is teeming with intelligent life, including multidimensional beingsDr. Alexander's journey also confirms the existence of intelligent life far beyond Earth. As he explains in Proof of Heaven:I saw the abundance of life throughout the countless universes, including some whose intelligence was advanced far beyond that of humanity. I saw that there are countless higher dimensions, but that the only way to know these dimensions is to enter and experience them directly. They cannot be known, or understood, from lower dimensional space. From those higher worlds one could access any time or place in our world.This not only confirms the existence of other intelligent civilizations throughout our known universe, but more importantly the existence of multidimensional beings who can come and go from our realm as they please.Throughout the cultures of the world, there are countless accounts of advanced beings visiting Earth, transferring technology to ancient Earth civilizations, and possibly even interbreeding with early humans. Even the very basis of Christianity begins with the idea that an omnipresent multidimensional being (God) can intervene at will, and can therefore transcend time and space.Alternative researchers like David Icke also talk about multidimensional beings visiting Earth and infecting the planet with great evil. According to Icke, the globalist controllers of our planet are literally reptilian shape-shifters who have invaded our world for the purpose of controlling and enslaving humanity. Although nothing like this is covered in Dr. Alexander's book, it is not inconsistent with what Dr. Alexander was told by God during his coma... Namely, that there are multidimensional realities, that certain high-vibration beings can traverse those realities at will, and that Earth is infested with a great evil with the specific purpose of testing our character.If all this sounds a little too spooky for you, consider the words of the Bible itself: An upright talking reptilian snake spoke in audible words to Adam and Even in the Garden of Eden, did it not?The science skeptics are wrong (again)Regardless of what you might think about multidimensional beings, intelligent life beyond Earth, and the existence of great evil on our planet, there's one aspect of all this that's crystal clear: The science skeptics are dead wrong.Science \"skeptics\" are actually misnamed. They aren't skeptical at all. They simply follow their own religion with its own sacred beliefs that cannot be questioned... ever! Those beliefs include the utter worship of the materialistic view of the universe. Simultaneously, so-called \"skeptics\" do not believe they are conscious beings themselves because they believe consciousness is merely an \"artifact\" of biochemical brain function.There is no afterlife, they insist. There is no mind-body medicine, the placebo effect is useless, and there's no such thing as premonition, remote viewing or psychic phenomena. Oh yes, and they also insist that injecting yourself with mercury, MSG and formaldehyde via vaccines is actually good for you, that fluoride chemicals are good for the public health and that we should all eat more GMOs, pesticides and synthetic chemicals.It's no surprise these religious cult members of the \"scientism\" cult don't believe in an afterlife. That's what allows them to commit genocidal crimes against the human race today via GMOs, experimental medicine, toxic vaccines and other deadly pursuits. In their view, humans have no souls so killing them is of no consequence.As Dr. Alexander says,Certain members of the scientific community, who are pledged to the materialistic worldview, have insisted again and again that science and spirituality cannot coexist. They are mistaken.Well of course they are. The \"science skeptics\" are dead wrong about almost everything they claim to advocate. But their biggest mistake of all is in denying the existence of their own souls. Needless to say, they are all going to fail the human experience simulation once they pass on and face judgment. My, what a surprise that will be for those sad souls when they day arrives...I would hate to face God one day after having lived a life of a science skeptic, and then have God ask the question: \"You doubted ME?\" How could anyone take a look at the world around them and not see the signs of an intelligent Creator? Even the very laws of physics have been tweaked and fine-tuned in precisely the right balance so that our universe itself can support the formation of stars, and planets, and carbon-based life forms. This is called the \"Goldilocks Enigma,\" and there's a wonderful book by that same name written by Paul Davies.No biochemical explanation for Dr. Alexander's experienceFor those skeptics who may be reading this, Dr. Alexander goes through nine possible biochemical hypotheses for his experiences and then meticulously and scientifically dismisses them all one by one. The result? His experience was REAL. In fact, it was \"more real\" than life as a human being.Remember, Dr. Alexander is a neurosurgeon. This guy knows the physical brain like no one else. The nine medical explanations he considers and dismisses as possible causes for his experience are:1) Primitive brainstem program.2) Distorted recall of memories from the limbic system.3) Endogenous glutamate blockade with excitotoxicity.4) DMT dump.5) Isolated preservation of cortical regions of the brain.6) Loss of inhibitory neurons leading to highly levels of activity among excitatory neuronal networks to generate an apparent \"ultra-reality.\"7) Activation of thalamus, basal ganglia and brainstorm to create a hyper-reality experience.8) Reboot phenomenon.9) Unusual memory generation through archaic visual pathways.Dr. Alexander may be the most credible afterlife witness in the history of humanityDr. Alexander's experience (and subsequent book) is arguably the best-documented case of the afterlife that exists in western science today. The fact that a vivid, hyper-real afterlife was experienced by a science skeptic materialistic brain surgeon who didn't believe in the afterlife -- and who subsequently found the courage to document his experiences and publish them in a book -- adds irrefutable credibility to the experience.This was not some kook seeking fame on a TV show. In fact, his writing this book earned him endless ridicule from his former \"scientific\" colleagues. There was every reason to NOT write this book. Only by the grace of God was Dr. Alexander healed of his e.coli infection, restored to normal brain function, and granted the VISION of the afterlife so that he could return to this realm and attempt to put it into words.Personally, I believe Dr. Alexander, and his experience mirrors that of countless others, across every culture, who have reported similar NDEs (Near Death Experiences). There is life after life, and the shift in consciousness of Earthlings that is required to take our species to a higher level of understanding begins, I believe, with embracing the truth of the immortality of our own souls (and the existence of a grand Creator).What does it all mean?Dr. Alexander's spiritual journey gives us a wealth of information that can help provide meaning and purpose in our daily lives.For starters, it means that all our actions are recorded in the cosmos and that there are no secrets in the larger scope of things. You cannot secretly screw somebody over here on Earth and think it won't be recorded on your soul forever. It also means that all our actions will be accounted for in the afterlife. If this message sounds familiar, that's because an identical idea is the pillar of every major world religion, including Christianity.It also means there are people living today on this planet whose souls will literally burn in eternal Hell. There are others whose souls, like Dr. Alexander, will be lifted into Heaven and shown a greater reality. What we choose to do with our lives each and every day determines which path our souls will take after the passing of our physical bodies.What matters, then, is not whether you actually succeed in defeating evil here on Earth, but rather the nature of your character that emerges from all the challenges and tribulations you face. This is all a test, get it? That's why life seems to suck sometimes. It's not a panacea; it's a testing ground for the most courageous souls of all -- those who wish to enter the realm of great evil and hope they can rise above it before the end of their human lifespan.\" - Mike AdamsSee all of my reviews.

And maybe that's the point....we're all children when it comes to the Creator. It is also interesting as he was going through the exhausting process of re-entering the conscious world (I did it as a child, and it is exhausting), he had a strong sense that there was a little person for whom he was still responsible: his devastated 10 year old son. It is not the first time that Love has proven powerful enough to wake the dead. Helps me understand God's willingness to redeem...that while we are yet a long way off, God sees us and looks upon us with compassion.Alexander is clear that there will be naysayers and those who will disparage his experience...and I am glad he realized that up front...the reviews already show that; however, he has crafted a beautiful experience for all, and a carrot to entice the medical community to rethink their explanations of NDE's. Another doctor, writing almost 2,000 years ago recorded, \"Even if one rises from the dead [to detail the afterlife], they will not believe him.\" Oh well. It did not bother Dr Luke to tell the truth, so I hope it won't bother Dr Eben.If there is any criticism, it would be that the clinical descriptions are a little medical-terminology-heavy. I still had to look up a few terms, despite medical training. My suggestion (unless you're a medical professional) is to buy the Kindle version so that you can instantly look up the jargon by simply pressing the word. But even if you don't have a Kindle or IPad, you'll \"get\" what is most important: Love.",

    "reviewText": "I purchased both the Audio CD's and Book about a month after my husband passed away from battling heart disease for over 30 years. I wanted the family to be introduced to a more substantial look at the near death experience and since Eben Alexander was a neurosurgeon, from a scientist's background, I found that his views might be the best of the best.In 1974, I myself had a near death experience which was very powerful and very spiritual, which I have detailed in my personal website.[...]Like Eben Alexander, following my own NDE, I started reading everything I could find on this very mystical experience.  In 1975 our family purchased an already existing Christian Book Shop which was in the Catholic tradition.  Our clientele was very progressive and I was introduced to many authors and was able to search out and get more comfortable with my own experiences.  I will give you a listing at the end of my review.Dr. Alexander early in his book gives us the most important message of his experience.  That we are all loved unconditionally.  This is very hard for him to put into words and also very hard for most of us to accept.  Not many of us have had the opportunity to experience this overwhelming love that seeps deeply into one's soul.  This is why it is almost impossible to put into words, it loses it's potency.  Thomas Aquinas on his death bed experienced the beatific vision (God/Om).  He told his contemporaries that all that he had written before this vision was all straw. (Summa Theologiae).Dr. Alexander, being a scientist and trying to meld the spiritual in his life was very difficult for him before he experienced his NDE.  After his NDE, trying to explain this to his colleagues.His son Eben IV, suggested that he not read any books until he wrote his own observations.  This was very wise advice.  One does not want to mix other people's, thoughts, beliefs,  experiences with his/hers.  I myself, did the same.But reading we must because this confirms and explains the phenomenon of the experience(s).

Whether one is religious or not, the experience of neurosurgeon Eben Alexander, demonstrates there are some definitions of brain-death that are not clear cut.Dr. Alexander tries to define the gateways of death in scientific terms and he is convinced his experience took him to another sphere, a reality that did not match the customary description of a christian heaven but certainly had the all consuming sense of peace and acceptance that many religions grant exists in an afterlife.It goes without saying that his survival of this near death experience changed his life.  Dr Alexander doesn't claim to have all the answers, however.  He concedes there are many people who have different experiences.  His personal journey is offered as another glimpse through the fog that surrounds the question where do we go when we die?Whether or not the reader agrees with all of Dr Alexander's conclusions is not important.  That this story was shared gives opportunity for deeper consideration that each of us can give the concepts.",

It was as if the Universe were saying, pay close attention, just as it did years ago when I kept hearing `A Course in Miracles-Original Edition' mentioned over and over or last year when I learned ofDying To Be Me: My Journey from Cancer, to Near Death, to True Healing. It appears that this is another one of those `wake up calls' from [y/our] BEING.  And so it is!The most significant facets of this Near Death Experience [NDE] are:*  The person who experienced it was a skeptical neurosurgeon scientist.*  The CORTEX of his brain was not functioning yet he experienced crystal clear clarity.*  He had a complete and total recovery from E. coli meningitis, which is a medical miracle.We may have seen television shows regarding NDE's which often begin with phenomenal claims of other worldly experiences and end with a scientific de-bunking using medical science of the brain to prove it was `all in their head.' The evidence the scientists present is offered in an effort to show that there IS no `scientific proof' that these experiences were anywhere but in the physical brain. This is exactly how Eben [Dr. Alexander] thought until his own first-hand experience of an NDE.Dr. Alexander writes: \"The more I read of the \"scientific\" explanations of what NDE's are, the more I was shocked by their transparent flimsiness. And yet I also knew with chagrin that they were exactly the ones that the old \"me\" would have pointed to vaguely if someone had asked me to \"explain\" what an NDE is.\"You may have see Dr. Alexander on Oprah, NBC, ABC, Fox, Cover of Newsweek etc. Why is he out there is such a big way? He answers that question himself:\"Without recovering that memory of our larger connectedness, and of the unconditional love of our Creator, we will always feel lost here on earth.\" P.171Dr. Eben Alexander, husband, father, neurosurgeon  contracted the extremely rare condition of E. coli meningitis completely out of the blue. Only 1 in 10 Million people will do the same. He made a full recovery one month after lying in a coma, near death, for seven days. This book is his best attempt at trying to share an experience which was truly beyond words.As the book progresses, his story becomes an exquisite tapestry.  The experiences of his family and friends and doctors in the hospital, dealing with this grave E coli infection, are interwoven with a recounting of Eden's experience as a consciousness, with no connection to the past, in a `place' where words could never do it justice.Even though it kept the attention of the reader by the vacillating between the solid world that we know and the ephemeral albeit Real world that Eben was experiencing, it wasn't until toward the end of the book that I found myself grabbing for the tissues.There is a part of Eben's life that I have not mentioned and it has everything to do with the message he received and more importantly the Being who brought the message to him. Now I leave that mystery of WHO that was for you to discover, dear reader, although the message itself is for all to know and to remember.\"You are loved and cherished, dearly, forever.\"\"You have nothing to fear.\"\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\"~ Reja Janaki Joy GreenOmaha, NE",

Oh yes, I agreed 100% with his thoughts on the environmental damage we've done and the horrific permission of murdering animals. I too had a close encounter with a moose while at Portage Glacier in Alaska and his account vividly refreshed that memory including the goose bumps and spiritual wonder of it all.

I admit I like my humor interspersed with some aspects of reality -- you get the real impression that neither of these guys was truly prepared for the trip, and thus what happened was all the more real for it.  Bryson brings in serious moments, too, but in ways that do not remotely detract from the book.  It's not supposed to be a slap-happy humor book after all, but better for it not being so.If you are considering a seriously major hiking event, I'd recommend this for things NOT to do, as well as a good broad perspective.

Whether or not you believe that Dr. Alexander did reach heaven, is for the reader to judge and in my opinion irrelevant.

I enjoyed this book from beginning to end, and read it in one night, I was THAT hooked. The characters, the plot, the wording....it all really wrapped itself around me and left me in awe.With a character by the name of Molly (ahem...cough*cough*....it's a VERY good name, if I might say so), you can't go wrong. Well, you COULD go wrong, but Melissa Foster did NOT go wrong. I loved the characters, the little lost girls were my favorite and my heart truly went out to them. And the plot line....well, if you engross yourself into the story the way I did, the story becomes reality. I found myself feeling as though I was Molly Tanner, seeing the visions and the emotions of trying to salvage my marriage. It was all quite an experience. Vanishings, mystery, drama, family, and secrets. The key elements that make up this INCREDIBLE novel!I highly, without doubt, recommend this to every reader. There is something in this novel that will hook everyone. With twists and turns that don't leave you hanging, and an ending that will leave you hungry for more Melissa Foster work, this 5 star book is worth the read!

    "reviewText": "What you won't get:1.) A loving and detailed description of streets paved with gold and dancing angels.2.) Proof.What you *will* get:A narrative that is divided into two alternating parts: One part is what others are doing (mostly family members) while Alexander is in a coma. The other part is what Alexander is experiencing during the Coma. His description is undoubtedly thinner than what most would probably like but narrative description doesn't seem to be one of Alexander's gifts. We can't all be poets. Alexander dedicated his life to being a highly trained and accomplished neurologist, not a John Steinbeck. (What Alexander *does* spend considerable time describing is the emotional impact the experience was having on him.) More to the point: Once one reads enough NDEs, one realizes that NDEs are highly subjective experiences filled with symbolism and archetype. Was the butterfly Alexander rode during his NDE \"real\"? Yes and no. Yes, it was real in a subjective and symbolic sense. The butterfly was obviously a potent symbol and it doesn't take much insight to guess its meaning. Will the next person, during their NDE, ride or see a butterfly? No, but they may experience something \"like\" the butterfly, and something just as powerfully meaningful. Reading NDEs for what heaven \"looks like\" may be gratifying (like eating popcorn) but that's not what NDEs are about. The NDE landscape is different for each person because what matters isn't what's *seen*, but what's *meaningful*. To one person what's meaningful is an angel with wings. To another, that \"angel\" will be a child, on orb or a beautiful sphere of light. Judge Alexander's NDE not for what he did or didn't see, but for what he learned concerning life, our place in it, and Love. These are universal lessons common to nearly all NDEs. The only difference is in the symbolism used to express and communicate these ideas:\"You are loved and cherished, dearly forever.\"\"You have nothing to fear.\"\"There is nothing you can do wrong.\"What is a tour of heaven going to add to these sentiments?*Proof*First thing to be said is that Alexander initially opposed the title of the book. The title was given by the publisher, Simon & Schuster.\"I didn't really consider this book to be scientific proof of anything,\" he said.Alexander's book, as he himself states, is written for the \"second camp\" of readers \"who have heard about NDEs, either by reading about them or--because they're extraordinarily common--by having a friend or relative who had undergone one. These people in the middle were the ones my story could really help.\" It's not written to persuade the atheist or the devout skeptic. He's spent his life comforting and healing, and this book (in his view) is an extension of that. If you're looking for proof, you're not going to find it in this book at least (which makes the title unfortunate). Alexander intimates that he will write another book (or \"paper\" perhaps) intended for the more scientifically and skeptically oriented. With that in mind, and despite the claims of many critics (and reviewers here at Amazon) Alexander *does* address the issue of *when* his NDE may have occurred. He is inclined to eliminate the possibility that the entirety of the NDE occurred during the brief hours (or less) when his neocortex presumably began to recover. He writes:8. A \"reboot phenomenon\" -- a random dump of bizarre disjointed memories due to old memories in the damaged neocortex, which might occur on restarting the cortex into consciousness after a prolonged system-wide failure, as in my diffuse meningitis. Especially given the intricacies of my elaborate recollections, this seems most unlikely.So, this would be Alexander's response to critics like Sam Harris, Richard Carrier and numerous armchair atheists and self-styled philosophers. Here's one typical response by someone named PZ Myers://\"Notice that key phrase: \"words registered later\". He was not writing this stuff down while he was in a brain-dead state; I would argue that he was also not experiencing them at that time. These were stories that he built later, as he was coming to grips with that past trauma, and they were a means of coping with a huge painful gap in his memory. We know that this is what our brains do; it fills gaps in our knowledge with imaginary events to maintain continuity, a process called confabulation.\"//This \"dismissal by confabulation\" is a current favorite among skeptics, and simply in terms of evidence there *is* none. Skeptics, when offering \"confabulation\", are indulging in a mechanism which actually has less to support it than non-local consciousness. There is no evidence that \"confabulation\" can create a lucid, meaningful narrative and experience on par with the NDE. It's a leap, an assumption that skeptics are willing to make, but there is (as of yet) *no* evidence to support that leap. If you read any skeptic who says otherwise, ask them to provide the evidence, the study, or the link to the paper that backs up their assertion. They can't. All they can point you to (which they somehow can't be bothered to defend) is research that does *not*, in fact, suggest the brain is capable of creating the lucid narrative of an NDE. Alexendar is also aware of this, being a neurosurgeon. If confabulation were remotely capable of producing an NDE I trust that Alexander would be the first to suggest it (and most likely accept it). More importantly, many, many NDEs occur when the brain is *not* recovering from the type of trauma that would induce confabulation. This also indicates that confabulation is not a reliable or likely explanation for NDEs. It is, however, sufficient for skeptics who, when a lack of evidence works in their favor, are hypocritically willing to accept that insufficiency.And this raises another issue. I have yet to read a response, from a skeptic, that was remotely convincing. All the skeptics I have read fall back on discredited explanations (explanations discredited by other skeptics, mind you), and offer no supporting evidence that backs up their assertions. This is skepticism turned Scientism. Skepticism requires knowledge concerning the subject being investigated; but all the dismissive skeptics I have read display little knowledge of the NDE. They end up expressing a priori opinions based on a reductionist or materialist belief system that is, at root, no different than any religious belief system.Another avenue which critics take is to ridicule the content or the message expressed in Alexander's NDE://\"But of course not. He returns from his mind-expanding experience and does not sit down to write a revolutionary new paper on the science of the mind, but instead, as usual, writes a bunch of banal drivel about angels. This is the deep message that he shares with us that would have taken years to fully grasp...\" ~ PZ Myers//Whether one thinks the NDE was banal is as red as the red herring can get. Who cares whether Myers thinks Alexander's NDE was banal? (I personally find Myers' article to be pompous and banal - especially when he can't come up with anything better than to write \"bullshit\"). The issue isn't whether the NDE was transcendent (how can one communicate such an experience - real or not?), but that it occurred at all. According to every current model of the brain, Alexander's brain shouldn't have been able to produce a lucid experience.Don't believe skeptics who write that there's no evidence to support non-local consciousness. That's complete rubbish. There is a mountain of evidence suggesting that consciousness is non-local. The only issue is in how one *interprets* that evidence. To date, skeptics have singularly and indisputably failed to provide a brain-based explanation for the NDE. This does not mean they won't. What it means is that any assertion that consciousness is purely the product of the brain is a statement of belief -- of a reductionist belief system. Period.For example, here's Victor Stenger://This is nothing more than the classic argument from ignorance,\" wrote physicist Victor Stenger, the author of the best-selling book \"God: The Failed Hypothesis: How Science Shows that God Does Not Exist.\"\"The flaw in the argument should be obvious. Just because someone -- or even all of science -- currently cannot provide a natural explanation for something, it does not follow that a natural explanation does not exist or will never be found,\" he wrote.//The fundamental flaw in Stenger's argument should be obvious. He thinks he knows what \"natural\" is. He believes (operative word being \"believes\") that what is natural entails a fairly circumscribed reductionist or materialist belief system. Here is Wikipedia://\"Metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy which maintains that nature encompasses all that exists throughout space and time. Nature (the universe or cosmos) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal physical substance--mass-energy. For example, astronomer Carl Sagan, an agnostic, described the cosmos as \"all that is or ever was or ever will be.\"[1] Non-physical or quasi-physical substance, such as information, ideas, values, logic, mathematics, intellect, and other emergent phenomena, either supervene upon the physical or can be reduced to a physical account. The supernatural does not exist, which is to say, only nature is real[2], i.e. Atheism.\"//Stenger, like Richard Carrier and other skeptics, is a Metaphysical Naturalist. Metaphysical Naturalism, it needs to be pointed out, *is a belief system*. Science does not support metaphysical naturalism (or Stenger or Harris or any of the other self-styled \"skeptics\"). Science is a methodology, not a belief system.The methodology of science is best expressed, not by the Metaphysical Naturalist, but by the *Methodological* Naturalist://\"Methodological naturalism is concerned not with claims about what exists but with methods of learning what is nature. It is strictly the idea that all scientific endeavors--all hypotheses and events--are to be explained and tested by reference to natural causes and events. The genesis of nature, e.g., by an act of God, is not addressed. This second sense of naturalism seeks only to provide a framework within which to conduct the scientific study of the laws of nature. Methodological naturalism is a way of acquiring knowledge.\"//The methodological naturalist does not make proclamations concerning the nature of NDEs, consciousness, reality or God. *Science* properly recognizes that the jury is still out. Again, there is mounting evidence that allows for the interpretation that consciousness is non-local. If that offends the belief systems of individuals like Carrier, Myers, Harris or Stenger, then they'll just have to suck it up (just like their religious brethren, who still refuse to belief in evolution or a 4.6 billion year old earth). Nobody should treat their pronouncements any differently than the pronouncements made by adherents of any other threatened belief system.Parting thought: I hope Alexander follows up this book with something more scientifically minded. As far as skeptics go, this book is low hanging fruit. The real test for Alexander will be in confronting the belief systems of his colleagues. He has the knowledge to make the argument and I look forward to hearing it.At the close of the book, Alexander writes:\"I know there will be people who will seek to invalidate my experience anyhow, and many who will discount it out of court, because of a refusal to believe that what I underwent could possibly be \"scientific\" -- could possibly be anything more than a crazy, feverish dream.... [But] here I am. I'm still a scientist, I'm still a doctor, and as such I have two essential duties: to honor the truth and to help heal. That means telling my story.\"One stylistic observation:What's with the incomplete sentences Mr. Alexander? They're not necessary and they *do* tend to confuse.",

But if you were watching a motion picture, or a TV program, that had Jack as one of the main characters, and his comrades referred to him in that exalted way, you would take it in stride. Imagine Jack, as the young sniper in \"Saving Private Ryan\". With that being said, let's continue with the review. I felt this was an excellent book, and one of the things that appealed to me, as a U.S. Veteran, is that Jack and his co-writers, wrote in the \"language\", that is truly spoken between men, not only in war, but in training for war. Another thing that I really liked, was the fact, that as bad as Jack wanted to be a sniper, he then had even higher goals. He had the desire, to not just be the best sniper, but he had the drive and vision, to try to improve the entire operating procedure of snipers. The battlefield, was not the same as in World War II. A couple of earlier Marine marksmen, Hathcock and Mawhinney, showed in Viet Nam, \"that snipers could be much more aggressive and effective by getting out of their holes and going on the hunt.\" I know what Jack meant, when he describes the anguish, of not only keeping classified missions to yourself, but also, dealing with the uncontrollable memories of death you've created, that reverberate in your dreams, that you can't discuss with anyone, including your wife. Jack says: \"If I awoke suddenly in the middle of the night, with a start so violent, that it shook the bed, Kim knew not to question why or what was going on in my head. She was careful not to startle me with a sudden touch.\" This passage, sent chills up and down my spine, since in my own life, twenty years after I was out of the service, I was a single father, who always wanted my young son to wake me, before he left for school, and give me a kiss. He got scared, at the way I would wake up, swinging and yelling, about things I never told anyone. We then used a procedure, where he would come into my bedroom, tap my shoulder, and then run to the doorway, and after I got back to normal, I would give him a hug and kiss goodbye. I would like to give one last comparison of Jack's stature, especially, for the benefit of people that weren't in the military. I was awarded the \"Small Arms Expert Marksmanship Ribbon, (SAEMR) with an M-16. Comparing that, to what Jack did, is like you comparing your two-year-old son's, hitting a wiffle ball, off a plastic tee, to the accomplishments of Babe Ruth. There are three things I'm happy for, after reading this book: 1) That Jack was on our side. 2) That Jack got home alive. 3) That Jack and his cohorts wrote this book. God Bless America!P.S. The 2007 movie with the same name, has absolutely nothing to do with this book.",

However, I decided to open it and at least I could say I 'tried' to read it.  Wow!  The first thing that struck me was the passion and honesty that translated through the words of Dr. Alexander... then when I saw he had practiced at Brigham & Women's Hospital, in Boston... I quickly contacted a trusted, longtime friend who also worked there at the same time.  I told her what I was  reading and that it sat open on my desk... she used 3 words... \"I believe him\".  That's all I needed... because it was exactly what I was thinking, too.  After chatting for a bit, I hung up and turned the page, I finished this book excited to share it with every one!

    "reviewText": "Without cracking open a page, I knew \"Chasing Amanda\" was going to be a great book.  I had recently read Melissa Foster's \"Megan's Way\" and was so wrapped up in her writing style, that I knew she wouldn't disappoint.  She didn't, in fact, I found it difficult to decide which book I loved more!\"Chasing Amanda\" is a book about regret, redemption, \"gifts\", the balancing of family and doing what's right, and so much more.  Melissa is a master storyteller who can lead us masterfully from the horrors of a child's abduction to the resolution of another's with the finesse of a writer whose work is far beyond her years.  She will have you drawn in like a lamb and have your emotions twisting inside of you before you know what's hit you!Characterization is key in this novel and it is achieved to such a fine point that each person is \"living\" and breathing in our minds.  My favorite, of course, is Molly who has to live with seeing and not helping with a child's abduction.  Molly's paranormal gift of \"seeing and knowing\" help her in her journey to understand many things, but it also makes some things in life more complex.  As we are drawn into the complexities, and we're given different perspectives through the stories of different people that Melissa sets up, we struggle to sort out who the real villain is!Ms Foster's ability to keep the ending a secret from the reader is a lot of the powerfulness of her novel.  The suspense will kill you!  In a good way...  One of the fascinating elements of the novel is Molly's relationship to the small town she finds herself in.  We can understand this small town mentality...the secretive ways that so many townspeople hold dear...and the barriers to newcomers they put up.  To live with the resistance of these people lends a tension to the story that works.Melissa is at the top of her game in writing this suspense thriller.  It's great fun to read, engrossing and exciting with many characters that will grab you and claim your attention.  The element of not knowing who the \"bad guy\" is until Molly finds out in the end, is wonderful because it keeps us working on the mystery.There are lots of women mystery/suspense writers, not so many with the element of paranormal...and not so many who come close to writing as well as Melissa Foster.  \"Chasing Amanda\" has already won several awards for best women's novel, suspense/thriller, paranormal. You better check it out, soon!5 stars for a great book and an author with a great future!Deborah/TheBookishDame",

    "reviewText": "\"I left my wedding dress hanging on a tree somewhere in North Dakota.\"These are the captivating words Cathy Lamb selected to begin her wonderfully crafted novel, Julia's Chocolates.  The mental image of a pristine wedding dress hanging limply from a lonely tree in the middle of nowhere is nothing short of genius.  From that sentence on, I had to know what one has to do with the other.Julia Bennett is no stranger to abuse.  Growing up neglected by her mother and abused at the hands of her mother's train of boyfriends, Julia finds herself trapped in a repeat the cycle with her fianc&eacute;e, Robert.  After years of enduring physical, sexual, and verbal insults at the hands of the man she is about to marry, Julia has a moment of clarity on the day of her wedding.  She reacts by fleeing to the sanctity of her beloved Aunt Lydia's farm in a small Oregon town.  On her way across the country, Julia stops in North Dakota and heaves her wedding gown over a roadside tree.At Aunt Lydia's eccentric farm, the story unfolds when five flawed women come together to offer one another love and support.  Each character is delightfully unique and colorful.  Julia, who is overweight, cursed with massive breasts, and afraid to love another man uses the creation of chocolate masterpieces as an escape.  Aunt Lydia grows her own marijuana, keeps the love of her life at arms length, and embraces the female spirit in a host of hilarious scenes.  Katie works herself ragged to support her children and her alcoholic husband.  At the same time, she does her best to shield her kids from their cruel and selfish father. Lara, a prim and proper closet alcoholic, grew up brainwashed and intimidated by the constant barrage of Christianity forcefully imposed upon her by her father.  She frees herself from her father's control only to marry the town pastor.  Attempting to be the perfect wife, Lara is slowly dying inside.  Caroline is the quirky town psychic with an uncontrollable twitchy eye.Through their weekly rendezvous referred to as \"psychic nights\" the women develop deep bonds with one another.  They also begin individual journeys of self-discovery and tackle the demons that have held them hostage for so much of their lives.Julia's Chocolates is a novel that addresses a host of serious issues: body image, sexual, physical and emotional abuse, alcoholism, homosexuality, domination through religion, and stalking.  Yet the real story is the beauty of the female spirit.  The characters aren't perfect, each of their lives messed up to varying degrees, and they all must sort through the issues that haunt them.  But they do it together.  With the support of one another, each woman emerges stronger as they venture down the road of self-discovery.  In a world where women seldom unite to display solidarity and pride in the female sex, this book is an inspiration.  Through the most unlikely cast of characters, Lamb shows the reader the power and resilience of the female spirit and the pure beauty of the bond of womanhood.After reading this novel, I am in awe of Cathy Lamb.  The woman has an incredible gift - the uncanny ability to bring the most bizarre characters and imagery together and create a masterpiece.  Lamb combines an eclectic mix of humor, tragedy, abuse, victimization, and outrageous scenarios to create a story that on the surface is pure entertainment, but woven into all of this is a much deeper message.Cathy Lamb has a style all her own, and her writing skills are superb.  Beyond that, it's the uninhibited craziness that she's not afraid to introduce into the story that makes me love her work.  It wasn't until after I completed the book and started looking into Cathy's blog that I learned that Julia's Chocolate was her debut novel.  If Julia's Chocolates was her starting point, I can only imagine where she has gone from there.  I am a true fan, and will continue to read her other books.  Thank you, Cathy, for being you and for allowing the rest of us to share in your feisty spirit.Julia's Chocolates, &#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;&#9733;Disclaimer: I purchased Julia's Chocolates from Amazon.  I did not receive any compensation or endorsement for my review.  It is an honest, unbiased assessment of the author's work.",

    "reviewText": "Bill Bryson captured my attention by making me laugh.  There were many moments in the first few chapters were I found myself laughing outloud while fellow train passengers or coffee shop customers strained their necks to see first who was making such a racket and then what, exactly, I was reading.  I was happy to oblige them by flashing the cover because I think pretty much anyone would enjoy this book.Bill Bryson is funny because he doesn't take himself too seriously.  He knows he doesn't know much about camping in general and the Appalachian Trail specifically.  He knows he's overweight and out of shape and his partner on this adventure is even more so.  Unfortunately, he initially doesn't know enough to take the trail too seriously either...he's mentally prepared for the extremes of bears and snakebite, but not the tedium of 16 hours of daily hiking with no stunning view to keep himself going. But, his awakening experiences lead to more humor as he and Katz quickly succumb to, but then triumph over the difficulty and repetition of life on the AT.  Their conversations are hilarious.  The bizarre people they meet are fully entertaining.  Simultaneously I wished I was along for the trip, but also glad I was comfortably seated without a sixty pound pack weighing me down.As the story of Bryson's adventures continue, he masterfully interweaves environmental and historical lessons about the trail itself and the many towns and regions he visits along the way.  As Bryson walks, we learn bits of American history that are fascinating, but have managed to be overlooked by many others. Bryson's observations are engaging and contagious.  At many points I found myself putting the book down and drifting off into  my own memories of hiking through the mountains on a crip autumn day or of shivering in a rainsoaked sleeping bag in a pile of mud.  His writing made me get outside, go for a walk at the woods, and just stare at the trees.  And then I actually went and bought a book on tree identification so I could learn even more!This book made me laugh, inspired me to reconnect with the outdoors, and gave me a whole lot of respect for those who attempt to hike the AT.",

The couple's own child is her age and she becomes a \"friend\" to the child until she grows up and it becomes apparent that she was to serve them without pay and without any prospects.  She attends school up to the 8th grade but the mother puts a stop to it and insists she stay a servant.  There is a second story, less intriguing and less well developed about a woman named Biso who was loved by a married man, had children and is now barely able to care for herself.  This story is very confusing and less interesting that you wonder why the author included it until the story converges near the end of the book.  Latha is a woman I found very interesting and loved her story.  She is the young girl raised to be a servant.  Jealous of her friend's marriage prospects, she seduces the girl's fiance with disastrous consequences for all concerned, even herself, though she doesn't fully understand what she has done.  I really enjoyed this book and was engrossed in my reading all the way through.  The author did not make this story a fairy tale and did not provide unrealistic situations.  All the situations ring true in Sri Lankan society.  Ru Freeman really wrote a wonderful novel and I look forward to reading more novels and books by her.",

I am not someone who is especially comfortable in the woods, and the scene in LL Bean where they attempt to purchase equipment for their upcoming adventure is comedic genius. If you have read any of Bryson's other efforts, you know what to expect.Interspersed with the misadventures of this unlikely duo, we are treated to interesting asides on the history and development of the Appalachian trail, and some of the historical figures prominent in it's history. This was the best beach/fireside read I have ever come across; give it a try when you need something that is light, fun, yet informative at the same time.If you like this, the athor also has a few others that are a hoot.

An inspiration, she has done it again. Chasing Amanda, her second novel, hooked me right from the start. I didn't want this book to end.The characters were more than just descriptions on a page. They jumped out and pulled me, willingly, hungrily, into their lives.  I resisted putting this book down, night after night. I not only wanted to find out what would happen next--I needed to. Thank you, Melissa, for inducing so many late nights and tired mornings in search of coffee! Starbucks thanks you as well.A parent's worst nightmare--the disappearance of their child--leads Molly Tanner into a spinning web of intricate secrets kept by the people in this otherwise quiet town. Having lived, thankfully very briefly, through the feelings one gets when told their child is missing, I was drawn into the emotional story of the people of this town--most especially, Molly Tanner. She must fight against her husband's resistance, the resistance of the townspeople to talk about the past and her own personal demons. I spent night after night fully engaged in this story, trying to figure out the complex interactions and connections.Her relationship with her husband and son were genuine and the emotions were raw and authentic. Chasing Amanda is frightening and heart-warming, sad and inspirational. I loved every minute of it. I am so thrilled to have found this author at the start of her burgeoning career. It is going to be a real pleasure watching her writing get better with each subsequent book.This was a well-written and suspenseful story that you won't regret reading--at any price!",

Upon his return he came with an new insight into the meaning of life and how it should be lived and what science must eventually learn to be truly helpful.

He contracts a severe form of E. Coli meningitis and quickly falls into a coma.  During the coma he experiences a journey to a place of peace. It starts as cloudy place, which he calls the worm's eye view.  He then journeys to a sunny pasture land where he meets a lovely women who becomes his guide.  Finally he finds himself in a place that he describes as being in the middle of God himself.  After seven days in coma, Dr. Eben miraculously wakes up from his coma and fully recovers.Even though this book is not empirical scientific proof of the existence of heaven, his neurological explanations of the impossibility of his experience gives me hope that there really is more to this existence that our short time here on earth.  I would recommend this to anybody with an openness to the possibility of an existence of life after death.  If you completely don't believe in an afterlife, this book will most likely not help.",

Who cares if he walked the entire AT; it was the adventure and the excellent way in which he told his story--spinning interesting factoids, humor and honest yet not-so-flattering (but funny) observations--that made this book so wonderful.

    "reviewText": "Eben Alexander, M.D.: pristine medical and scientific credentials; experience in the top Boston hospitals, a sought-after neurosurgeon.  Suddenly he contracts E-coli bacterial meningitis and is comatose.  The disease is eating his brain and the prognosis is grim.  Eben is dying.Well, not quite.  Eben is very ill but his spirit is conscious and it has passed through a dull, flat space which offers a worm's eye view of experience (limbo cum purgatory?) and into the light, where he tastes the heavenly afterlife--not a place in the clouds but an all-encompassing spiritual plane in which understanding occurs instantaneously, love is omnipresent, there are guardian angels, figures floating in orbs, the Creator Himself and (thank you, Lord), dogs.The author examines all of the alternative, physiological explanations for his experience and realizes that they are all inadequate.  The scientist/sceptic by training becomes an intense believer.  The empiricist sees the experience for what it must be (assuming that there is no chemical delusion occurring here): the first stage of scientific proof.The author's heaven is so overwhelming that descriptions are, perforce, vague and inadequate.  The experience is not exactly ineffable or inexpressible, but it is so vast and so heightened that describing it is a struggle.  Fortunately, he writes well and we have a reasonably clear sense of the experience that he is laboring to describe.What is particularly interesting is the fact that his experience corresponds, in many ways, to what we have hoped to believe.  There are people there; there are angels there and there is contact with God there.  There are fields and skies, not so much an enclosed realistic, Edenic garden, but more like a beautifully-colored Rainbow-britelike space, a heightened, purified earthly landscape.Eben Alexander's heaven is one which particularly focuses on consciousness and understanding, spiritual learning at an unanticipated, nearly unimaginable level, a kind of infused knowledge.  Do we each have the kind of heaven that we would desire or is this the universal article?  The orbs suggest something out of Leibniz's Monadology and the author learns the reason for evil in the world: so that we might have authentic free will.  That's what Milton said, so perhaps he was right.Like the proofs for God's existence, near death experiences are more aids to piety than apodictic proofs, compelling belief.  Given the stakes, however, they certainly compel our attention and the author here is the perfect intermediary--the last person who would believe what he actually experienced, now with the faith of a convert.This is a lovely little book that all should read--believers, sceptics, searchers.  At the very least, the stakes involved put all of our daily travails in context and may serve to ameliorate them.Someone once said that it's not going to be heaven if there's no Ray Charles and others have said that hell is a place without Mozart.  There are sounds there as well, but mostly unconditional love and learning, people, angels, God . . . and dogs.",

The medical community can't brush it aside as easily as they do when your average person has a NDE.I also love that he doesn't have a religious agenda (he isn't trying to convert anyone).  A lot of other NDE accounts seem aimed at making you find religion OR ELSE.  I was only 1/3 of the book and was in tears.

    "reviewText": "This is actually a review of two books, one old and one new.  Both are nonfiction, and both are intended for grown-ups.  There's nothing in them that kids will find objectionable, but they may find them boring.  I found them to be funny, poignant at times, and thought-provoking.The first is called A Walk in the Woods, by Bill Bryson, published in 1997.  The second is called Scout's Honor, by Peter Applebome, published in 2003.  Bryson is a writer and journalist who decided to walk the Appalachian Trail at around age 50, and Walk is the story of his adventures on the AT.  Applebome is a writer and a journalist who decided to become a Boy Scout dad at around age 50, and Honor is the story of his adventures with his son's Boy Scout troop and with Scouting in general.I read Walk several years ago, and just discovered Honor last week.  Reading Honor reminded me of Walk, so much so that I couldn't review the former without talking about the latter.Bryson and a friend decided, almost on a lark, to hike the AT which they had heard so much about, but Bryson was so inexperienced a hiker that he couldn't tell a Nalgene from a North Face.  In fact, his introduction to backpacking and hiking occurred in a sporting goods store.  He and his friend started at the southern end of the AT, in Georgia, on a snowy autumn day, and ended, with a few breaks, at the northern end in Maine several years later.Bryson's writing is self-deprecating and intentionally funny.  He plays for laughs, and he gets them.  By poking fun at himself, he gives himself license to give all the other characters on the trail the same treatment he gives himself in his writing.  The book is funny throughout.  But just as Mark Twain and Will Rogers gave us lots of food for thought in the middle of their humor, so Bryson writes a series of thoughtful essays between the lines of his funny stories:  lessons about people's character and behavior, about greed and status, about environmental awareness and social responsibility, and about what Thoreau called \"the need for wilderness\" or something like that.  (Yes, Thoreau talked about it before John Muir did.)When you finish Bryson's book, you will be as satisfied with the conclusion as he was with the end of the hike.  You may also come away with a renewed appreciation for wild places and with an awareness of the personality flaws that make you similar to the characters Bryson writes about.  It's definitely a book I would read again.Applebome, like Bryson, knew nothing about hiking, camping and backpacking, until he moved his family from Atlanta to Chappaqua, New York, and his son wanted to join the Boy Scouts.  He was reluctant to get into the hiking and the canoeing, the knot-tying and the sleeping outside on the hard ground surrounded by rain, snow, wind and critters.  He had hoped that his son would express an interest in Little League baseball instead, but, wishing to score some Good Dad points with his son, he went along with him to the Boy Scout meetings and outings.Even before he started, Applebome had anti-Boy-Scout leanings -- but as he became more involved with his son's troop, that changed.  Interweaved with the funny and poignant story of his own adventures with his son's troop, Applebome tells a balanced, thoughtful, well-researched and honest story about the history of Scouting and its founders, its awkward attempts to adapt to social change, and the recent controversies surrounding it.  The book isn't all narrative -- it includes a lot of reporting, exposition and editorializing -- but it's definitely worth reading.Applebome comes the end of his book grateful for having been able to share the experience with his son, the troop leaders, and the other Scouts and their dads.  He himself grows considerably through his experiences, and he faces a huge crisis of conscience when the Boy Scouts win the Supreme Court judgement in their favor with respect to gays in Scouting.  The crisis of conscience occurs because he feels that the corporate organization that is the Boy Scouts of America is dead wrong on at least one of the \"three G\" issues (gays, God, and girls) and not faithful to the wishes of Scouting's founders, and yet he sees that the local organizations of Scouting, the councils and troops, are a powerful force for good in their communities and are getting a raw deal by both BSA headquarters and the left-wing liberals who get all over Scouting's case because of the three Gs.Being a reporter and a problem-solver at heart, he takes a long, hard look at what Scouting could be (and should be), compares it to what it is, and makes several really good recommendations for fixing Scouting.  One of the most interesting things he says is that the Scout Oath and the Scout Law, the moral foundations for Scouting (in the U.S.A.), are rock-solid and it woud be a very good thing if all boys (and men!) lived by those tenets.  He also says (either himself, or quoting someone) that the Boy Scout Handbook, any edition, is just the kind of \"advice to boys\" that people have been longing to give to boys today.Unfortunately, Scouting is increasingly irrelevant in a society which competes so heavily (and so much more effectively) for boys' attention with sports, video games, and so on.  Applebome laments this turn of events, and yet he asserts, with his primary evidence being the members of his own son, that Scouting appeals to a certain group of boys who really don't care if other people think it's uncool, and that Scouting (practiced the way it should be) really is a Good Thing in the boys' lives and is a major influence in turning them into the kind of men this world needs.  (Those are my words, not his.  He said it differently.)Scout's Honor is written to and for three groups of people:  former Boy Scouts who are now adults; current and former Boy Scouts; and current and former Boy Scout leaders.  It's high-energy food for thought for all three groups.A Walk in the Woods is written for everyone, and will be especially enjoyed by those who love or hate hiking, backpacking, camping, wilderness and the fools they find there.  Although it contains more mental junk food than food for thought, it will open your mind and is definitely worth reading.",

    "reviewText": "A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of \"Proof of Heaven\" (A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife)by Eben Alexander, MD, September 21, 2013My wife recommended this book that she purchased from Amazon and thought I would enjoy it.  I was skeptical about reading a book on this subject primarily because everything I heard about Near Death Experiences (NDE) have pointed to chemical or neurological events in the affected person's brain.  While I believe that there is an existence after death and a part of me agrees that \"we are spiritual beings living a human existence\", I still have some doubts because the evidence is not completely provable, i.e., as in a Court of Law.  Paradoxically, as a believer, I have faith that God loves me and will embrace me after I die but still in one little corner of my thinking, I harbor doubts that I hope God will forgive me for when I meet Him.I read this book with a very open mind and the credentials of the author are not one bit in doubt.  I believe he is a most rational person who had the same questions, before his experience, we all share.When I read some of the reviews on both Amazon and Goodreads, I was surprised how many negative ones there were, but out of almost 6,500  reviews almost 5,000 were positive, i.e., 4 stars or better and less than 1,500 were 3stars or less.  I am not sure what this spread of reviews points out but I do believe that every reader must make up his own mind based on his experiences.  I believe that this book presentation outlines, unabashedly, his firm belief. The authors medical arguments seem plausible and certainly by writing this book he leaves his self open to greater scrutiny from his peers in the medical profession.I do believe that anything we say or write is open for all to take their pot shots.  I have to say, I believe his writing style was very readable and enjoyable and I did not sense condescension from him one iota.  I did not sense a self loving narcissism as one critic did.  On the contrary, I found the author to be a very humble man who knew he was going to go out on a limb both professionally and socially.  His life's experiences, being adopted and then much later in life seeking answers, did not warp his sense of being.  I truly believe he was and is a dedicated scientist/physician and has undertaken a field of study in the medical profession that is not for the timid and yes if that requires a big ego, so be it.In reading this short, informative as well as entertaining book, I believe that he experienced something like a NDE, though not typical of other NDE reports, and I will not take issue either way.  After all, these were his experiences and he was willing to share it with all who will read his book; the reader believing it, was not his intent but rather that he believes it.  I do believe we will never have all the answers and that is the reason we have belief systems.  I can tell you, I do feel better about the unknown because I do believe in a \"Loving\" God.I highly recommend this book and give it, unhesitatingly, five stars.",

The trail population actually increased significantly upon the book's publication. By my lights, the more people who get outside and into the wilderness, the better off we will be as a country. So thank you Bill Bryson and thank you Stephen Katz for being the amiable foil.Hiking the Appalachian Trail and writing my own narrative, Skywalker--Close Encounters on the Appalachian Trail, (modeled on Bryson's irreverent narrative, if not quite as dashing!), have been two of the highlights of my life.Skywalker",

I listened to Dr. Alexander being interviewed by Dennis Prager on the radio. I had read the article he wrote in Newsweek. Because of his background as a neuro Surgeon at Harvard I had to figure a 2nd generation surgeon was dead solid serious in his perception of what happened to him in the 'brain dead' state of his coma. This was not a fundementalist layman who attributed God to making every discision in his life. Had he fell off a tractor while farming I doubt (no reflection on farmers) that his story would have reached Newsweek. As he said he doubted he would have believed a colleague with the same story.I don't know that he offers proof of heaven but he offers up the possibility of a heaven that I like to believe in. He tells you over and over that he doesn't have the vocabulary to even describe his experience but he does it in grand detail in my opinion. I had trouble putting in down. The book is written with a lot of medical reasons 'why' and why not these experiences could not just 'happen'.  I'm sure this will not give many skeptics a reason to do anymore that claim him crazy or at best delusional from the illness. For those of us that live with doubt and are open minded I think the book does offer you an explanation on why he now believes, even if it's just in the idea that belief is possible. Faith seems to be a gift that some have and some don't. Short of a personal experience, I get the idea that Dr. Alexander was not on the fast track to become a believer! Unfortunately most of us will not experience that type of conversion but it's a nice way to spend a few hours with someone who has had a life changing experience that we may never have.

It would be nice for once and for all to be absolutely convinced that it is true.  The story is supported by medical terminology so convincingly by the neurosurgeon author that a non-medical person cannot disprove it.  One wants to believe but feels in the end that the story can neither completely prove nor disprove the afterlife.  In the end the story, though fascinating, raises a lot of questions one perhaps cannot have answered in this life.  Persons who have experienced near death experiences cannnot be denied their belief in the afterlife.  I just wish their conviction could be so clearly easily expressed that it would be acceptable to the rest of us.",

His journey to the next world and back reads better than the best fiction; I literally could not put it down.  I had seen Eben Alexander's story on the TV series &#34;Beyond and Back&#34; and was thrilled when I heard he'd written a book about it.  That book turned out to be well-written and detailed, laying to rest the medical establishment's denial about the reality of near-death as a true account of continuing consciousness and not a fake euphoria driven by excess serotonin.  Dr. Alexander brings back confirmation that love is the causal center and meaning of life and that consciousness is everlasting.  For those who need a biblical-sized miracle (as if this weren't enough) the account of his spontaneous, and eventually complete, recovery ought to satisfy the toughest skeptic.  An important book that anyone of any faith (or of no faith, for that matter) should read.",

An attractive, blue-eyed brunette with athletic prowess, she is not happy about her dad being involved with a local art teacher named Meredith.  Meredith is pregnant and this is one major reason Aria does not want to spend the winter holidays with her dad, brother Mike, who is 2 years her junior and Meredith.  Instead of traditional winter holidays, Aria Montgomery's family celebrates Winter Solstice.  Aria and Mike spent 3 years in Iceland and while there, Aria acquires a yak-fur bag which becomes her security blanket.  I admit I was sick of that damn yak-fur bag which is featured in every book.  In this book, Aria surprises readers - there was NO WAY I saw THAT coming!Spencer is a grind.  She has an older sister named Melissa who has recently graduated from college and is viewed as the epitome of success.  Spencer sputters more than an old fuse and sooner or later you can count on her to keep on doing this.  The girls' mother decides what the family needs is a beach vacation and so they go to beach country where Spencer's volatile grandmother lives.  Fortunately the old bag is on her own trip, so the family can stay in her house free without her kid-unfriendly presence there to spoil things.  What DOES spoil things is the strife between the girls' parents; the way Spencer is treated like an unloved outcast by her own family and the cat fight she has over a tennis pro she meets.  There is a funny revenge scene which is just delightful!Emily, the swimmer who has been ostracized by others for being bisexual has been given a weird assignment.  Emily's mother gets her a job playing Santa in a local mall to infiltrate a clique of girls who are allegedly stealing Christmas decorations.  Her objective in getting Emily to do this - she wants the Baby Jesus that was stolen from her Nativity scene back.  The kicker is she wants to sell the Baby Jesus so as to buy more gifts for Emily, her 2 older sisters and brother.  This assignment puts Emily in a bad position, but the resolution is also delicious and quite unexpected!  As it turns out, it is Emily who has shown true holiday spirit!Hanna, who bears a strong resemblance to Cinderella is coping with her indifferent father and stepmother and beyotch of a stepsister, Kate, who is the same age as Hanna.  Hanna's mother took a job in Singapore and Hanna feels abandoned and Kate is always finding ways to get her into trouble.  Hanna's father appears to have replaced Hanna with Kate for a daughter and Kate has fangs and claws she will use at the drop of a hat.  You just want to kick Hanna's dad in the shins as he puts his own daughter down to Kate and sings Kate's praises to Hanna every chance possible.  Hanna's boyfriend is a nice guy (you'll have to read the book to know who it is in THIS installment).  However, she meets someone new who gets her involved in a worthwhile activity.  Hanna has an eating disorder and it resurfaces in this book.  However, with friendships shifting and changing, Hanna comes up with a very resourceful revenge scheme that is deliciously wicked!Each Liar has to deal with the havoc this mysterious A has wreaked.  The Liars try to think of ways to stay steps ahead of A.  Only Aria appears to take A in stride, despite her shocking secrets.  I admit that I never saw THAT one coming and it bowled me over!This book is a wonderful filler and is so refreshingly different in that there is nothing extraneous or predictable about it.  Readers learn a lot more about each Liar and gain new insights as to what makes these characters \"tick.\" The book is divided into 4 parts, with each Liar being given 15 chapters for readers to learn her story.It's best if you've read all the books in the series before you get to this one (at the time of this review, \"Ruthless #10\" being the most current).  You see the shadows that loom large in the girls' legends and you will feel the same hair raising, skin-prickly sensation of their encounters with the person or persons they think is A.Be sure to read the dust jacket as well so you will be updated on the latest message from A.  I love the PLL series and Sara Shepherd is a genius.  I can't wait to read the one following \"Ruthless!\"Kind of makes you hope A would stAy.",

I give the author credit for honestly relating his miraculous experience as he himself was able to interpret it. As far as the \"you can do nothing wrong\" bit - I would think twice about anything that meets you in the clouds and tells you something like that. If nothing we can do is \"wrong\" someone please explain the evil done by humans in this world. Perhaps this doctor had some type of experience and perhaps he believes he visited heaven, but being told that nothing you can do is wrong is a stretch for anyone who has ever experienced the thing called conscience. No matter what your beliefs, we all need to contemplate and pray about such things. I recommend Lin Tomasso's book Prayer Warrior: How to Get Your Prayers Answered to help do this correctly. Prayer is a formula, and this book shows how to do it correctly to achieve results. I downloaded it to my laptop (you can download it to any device) for $2.99 at smashwords.com. Tomasso is funny and down to earth, a great read. Apply the basic principles no matter what your belief system. I loved it.",

The is nothing more real than what is beyond the very limited reality we humans construct and enforce every day. Dr. Alexander shares a glimpse into a reality that challenges all assumptions and pulls us toward wholeness and love. What a blessing to know what he shares and to realize that our loved ones who go before us are very near to us.There are several reviews that rate this book as poor but in most of the ones I read, they did not understand that Dr. Alexander gives words to the ineffable. They fault him for not going into more depth about his NDE. The fact that he even tried to describe it is an accomplishment and a gift. Some critics also dislike him writing about his life but I don't understand why. What he experienced is deeply inter-related to life now and life to come. It's about relationships and how they affect us now and in what will be.",

He is witty, intelligent, knowlegdeable, and easily read, all at the same time.The book (non-fiction and usually found in a travel section of a book store) centers around the existence of the appalachian trail in the eastern U.S..  After spending years away from America, in the boorish land of the Brits, Bill discovers the trail and decides to hike it from end to end.  Initially he has trouble finding someone willing to go on this extended hike with him, but then an old school chum, Steven Katz, calls up and decides to join him.  The two are a rumbling, bumbling, out of shape and disjointed pair that have you chuckling many times as you read on.  Hiking the trail isn't an easy thing to do with your life on your back, or so they soon discover.  But they plod along and along the way the reader gets some interesting history behind the trails establishment, the people they meet along it's course, the states that they amble through, and the general decay of their minds as they begin to see nothing but mile upon mile upon mile upon mile of trail ahead of them.Did they hike the appalachian trail though?  That is a question that each reader will have to answer for themselves.  I think they did.  I've hiked many miles in Alaska and I know what it's like to be on trails like that.  They hiked it!

One of my professors had hiked a southern section of the Appalachian trail for his honeymoon in spring when the whole trail was in glorious bloom. It had been a spectacular experience which I had always envied, but never gotten the chance to copy. I'm afraid my Environmental Science Professor and his wife were ten times the outdoor people I would ever be. So this book was perhaps my vicarious trip on the Appalachian trail. I'm sure my adventures would have been similarly hilariously disastrous. I laughed so hard at almost every page of this book, that I probably got as much exercise as I would have had I hiked the trail. If you've ever harbored the seductive notion that getting back to nature is an easy trip, this book will riotously disabuse you of that misconception. If you like to laugh, get this book and read it often. And be sure to keep for those days when laughter is hard to come by.",

    "reviewText": "For anyone who is curious about what happens to us when we die (and that would include most of us), this is a fascinating and provocative read. Granted, it is nonfiction, and I will take the author at his word on this but, to his credit, the story unfolds like literary fiction. Meaning, it's riveting.What came to mind was a movie-length adaptation of an episode from the television series House: A healthy neurosurgeon is suddenly stuck down by a severe and puzzling form of meningitis and slips into a coma, resulting in a near-death experience (NDE), a preview of heaven, then a miraculous recovery with no brain damage, and the doctor returns to life to tell the tale.I appreciated the medical details the author brings to this memoir - which is not surprising since Alexander is a neurosurgeon who knows the ins-and-outs of this life-and-death business. So the fact that he is the one who becomes trapped on the other side of the glass, or mirror, metaphorically speaking - the doctor now the patient facing death - is a key factor in making this story resonate. If told by a car salesman or motivational speaker (no disrespect to these professions) - it just would not have the same impact.Proof of Heaven? I can practically hear the atheists screaming no! The believers shouting yes! And the agnostics shaking their heads every which way. Why? Because no one truly knows. That is the human condition: to wonder. As for me, the book helps confirm what I have felt most of my life. We have a soul. And death is not the final chapter.Also worth reading:heretofore.",

The reader is introduced to a Russian sniper who has more than three hundred kills and I will leave it at that.  The book is serious in nature, but also shows us that humor can be found just about anywhere; even on a battlefield.  Coughlin and Kuhlman lead us down some harrowing paths that leave the reader pondering about the brutal nature of war.Shooter is a great read for readers that want to see firsthand what being a sniper is all about.  The book is graphic at times but then so is life.  I would like to say thanks to Coughlin and Kuhlman for the service that they have done for our country and for sharing their experiences.

    "reviewText": "This is a wonderful \"autobiographical\" novel by Rosalind Miles and probably the book that got me hooked on British historical fiction and history. I have read this tome several times (and it is pretty big) and have loved it each time. It is still at the top of my favorites list (though it has been joined by SKP's Sunne!)It is wonderfully (and very believably) written in Elizabeth's \"voice\" and as a reader I could honestly see Elizabeth acting, thinking, and talking like that. Miles really makes her come alive in this telling that covers Elizabeth's earliest memories as a child, her precarious position during her brother and sister's reigns, the tumultuous early years of her own reign, and the numerous issues she had to deal with during her life (from about age 4 up until 2 years before her death). Elizabeth is portrayed in many different ways (flirty, vain, silly, brilliant, cunning, clever, stubborn, manipulative, caring) but they all fit together wonderfully and these different attributes are what made her an amazing queen. I think one of my favorite things about the novel is the humor you see from Elizabeth. I really enjoyed some of her \"one liners\" and her sense of humor. It really makes her seem human.Through Elizabeth's eyes you get a very interesting perspective on her father Henry VIII, her brother Edward, and her older sister Mary. Her feelings concerning her father change over the course of her lifetime and you really see the different events (and her maturing) that help bring about that change. She moves from loving and adoring him to fearing him and eventually hating him (quite a bit of that is due to what he did to her mother). You also see that she very much takes to heart the lessons to be learned when a woman marries and gives all the power to her husband. She has her mother's example always looming over her, she saw what happened to her stepmother Catherine Parr, and she also sees what happens to her sister Mary after she marries King Phillip. She also sees what befalls her cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, in her disastrous marriages. Who can blame her for not wanting to stumble into the same trap?There is a lot of time devoted to Elizabeth's male favorites, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, and the Earl of Essex, throughout the course of this novel. These two men played a large roll in her life and I did not mind reading about her feeling and interactions with them, especially Dudley. Elizabeth really does seem to have loved him and wanted to marry him but she knew she couldn't (and wouldn't want to) give up any power to a husband. In her mind she was married to England and England came first in her heart. As to the Earl of Essex, I never liked him and I wanted to shake Elizabeth a few times for letting him get away with some of the stunts he pulled. She even said many times that she knew what he was doing, that her feelings for him had died, that she realized he was a traitor, but she always forgave him. It took a very drastic act for her to finally have him arrested and sign the warrant for his execution.You can't talk about Elizabeth without mentioning her cousin Mary and Miles does a wonderful job of showing how torn Elizabeth was on this subject. She knew that Mary was a huge and dangerous threat to her and was well aware of her plotting to take the English throne. As a queen she knew that she should let Mary have the justice she deserved for plotting against her (many times) so as to secure the safety of her realm. However, Mary is after all an anointed queen (and her cousin) and she sees the danger in setting a precedent in which the Lords of a land can put a queen on trial and condemn her to death. She tells her councilmen many times that what they do to Mary could easily be done to her. Elizabeth really struggles with this for twenty years until she finally makes that ultimate decision. During all that time you can really sympathize with her and feel how hard she struggles with this.This is a wonderful book and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the Tudors. It is a well written novel and you really get a glimpse into what Elizabeth was really like (perhaps) and the sacrifices she(maybe) made to keep England safe.",

    "reviewText": "Having read dozens of books about near-death experiences (NDEs) and other phenomena strongly suggesting the survival of consciousness after death, I didn't read this book in search of \"proof\" of \"heaven.\"  I had already come to the conclusion that the evidence for survival, if not providing absolute proof, at least meets the \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" standard of our legal system.  However, just as the orthodox religious person needs to renew his or her faith by reading his/her \"good book\" over and over again and then attending weekly services to hear someone discuss the teachings of the book - discussions probably heard dozens of times before - I find a certain renewal and revitalization in reading newer accounts of NDEs.  Yes, the stories are often similar, as one might expect them to be if they are to be considered evidential, but there is usually enough variety to make the stories interesting, informative, intriguing, and inspirational, what I call the \"four I's.\"  This book exceeded my expectations, for each of those four I's.Because Dr. Eben Alexander, the author and experiencer, is a neurosurgeon who was for the most part a materialist with little interest in the subject of NDEs before his own NDE, this story has even more credibility than most, although the pseudoskeptics, in all their wisdom, were attempting to discredit the author as delusional and the victim of wishful thinking even before the book was released.  \"Like many other scientific skeptics, I refused to even review the data relevant to the questions concerning these phenomena,\" Alexander tells of his own pre-NDE mindset. \"I prejudged the data, and those providing it, because my limited perspective failed to provide the foggiest notion of how such things might actually happen.\"  He now sees such people \"who know the truth without needing to look at the facts\" as willfully ignorant.\"Brilliant, vibrant, ecstatic, stunning,\" Alexander describes the \"new world\" he found himself in after his physical body and brain completely shut down, admitting, as so many others have, that  human language and ideas fail when one attempts to translate celestial visions and experiences into terrestrial imagery and verbiage.  \"We taint, with out insufficient descriptions, their truly awesome nature,\" he offers, stressing his belief that what he experienced was \"more real than the house I sat in, more real than the logs burning in the fireplace.\"Alexander examines the usual NDE debunking theories, including endogenous glutamate blockade, REM intrusion, \"DMT dump,\" the \"reboot phenomenon,\" and \"feigned-death\" strategies, dismissing them one by one.  Everything he experienced suggested higher, not lower, brain functioning.  \"The more I read of the `scientific' explanations of what NDEs are, the more I was shocked by their transparent flimsiness,\" he states, going on to say that after studying the subject matter following his NDE, he began to realize his was \"a technically near-impeccable near-death experience.\"In one of the final chapters, Alexander tells of stories he had heard from patients before his experience - stories which he wrote off as fantasy, but which he now saw very possibly real.  He also mentions a very interesting story related to him by one of his colleagues involving \"terminal lucidity,\" in which the colleague's dying father, who had been demented, became lucid and in last moments alive.In his 1974 Pulitzer prize-winning book, \"The Denial of Death,\" anthropologist Ernest Becker stated that the fear of death haunts the human mind like nothing else. Most people deal with this fear by repressing it - burying it deep in the subconscious and busying themselves with mundane activities. And then, one day, perhaps when it becomes apparent that their days are numbered, those repressed anxieties relating to death begin welling up into the consciousness.  They proceed to live their final years under a dark and increasingly foreboding shadow.  For the most part, the muddled information provided by orthodox religion offers little relief, little comfort.  But books like this one serve to erase that fear and allow the person to embrace death, living his or her final years with a certain optimism.  I am grateful to Dr. Alexander for writing it and intend to buy a few extra copies to give as Christmas presents.",

    "reviewText": "This book should be of interest to anyone who has ever pondered the true nature of the universe, and, in particular, the relationship between the physical world --- the world in which we live --- and the so-called spiritual world about which we know so little of substance.  For, it describes a universe which few &#8216;living men&#8217; have ever visited: a spiritual realm which differs markedly from that described by any of our world&#8217;s great religions.This may present a problem for some readers.  For, while this &#8216;heaven&#8217; provides possible answers to some otherwise perplexing questions, it also challenges many long-standing and deep-seated beliefs.  What makes it so compelling, however, is that this book was written by a nationally renowned neurosurgeon who was once a staunch skeptic of &#8216;Near-Death Experiences&#8217; as reported to him over a period of some twenty-five years, but who was forced to reconsider when he, himself, experienced just such a revelation.The author&#8217;s life, and life view, changed suddenly and dramatically when he contracted an extremely rare form of what neurosurgeons term a &#8216;spontaneous E. coli bacterial meningitis infection,&#8217; an infection which few survive, and from which those who do survive generally require constant care for the remainder of their lives.  He lay dying in a coma for seven days while his doctors struggled vainly to diagnose and treat his illness, while, at the same time, the E. coli bacteria was destroying the outer cortex of his brain.  Then, when he was all but given up for dead, he miraculously recovered.  During his seven days in the coma, the author fell into a deep state of unconsciousness, closer to actual death than any other known patient.  In that state, he lost all sense of personal identity and entered into the spiritual realm which he discusses in this book.  He describes it as seemingly existing in three distinct states: a dark and foreboding &#8220;worm&#8217;s eye view&#8217; region, a &#8216;gateway&#8217; to an inner &#8216;core,&#8217; and a &#8216;core&#8217; --- that being the broader, glorious, all encompassing, universe of God in which he became immersed and of which our physical universe was seen as just a trivial part.The author acknowledges that his description of this spiritual universe is woefully deficient: due, as he says, to the fact that we are so limited here in our physical world that it is impossible to describe it with any degree of clarity, especially when constrained by the limited vocabulary we must use to do so.  But, what struck me most forcefully about his attempted description was the stark contrast between the universal reality which he describes and &#8216;God,&#8217; as we envision him in more personal terms.  But, as the author makes clear: in our limited physical world, we are forced to envision &#8216;God&#8217; in &#8216;our&#8217; own terms.  I was also struck by the fact that the author&#8217;s vision of heaven and the soul also coincides remarkably well with that described by the &#8216;sleeping prophet,&#8217; Edgar Cayce, as discussed in the book, &#8216;The Story of Edgar Cayce: There is a River,&#8217; by Thomas Sugrue.  It also goes a long way toward explaining how Cayce was able to do the incredible things he did.Bottom line: Although &#8216;heaven,&#8217; as described herein, runs counter to much of what we think we know, it offers a fresh view of a wondrous spiritual universe far beyond our wildest imaginings --- one which can&#8217;t be easily dismissed.",

The horrid tragedy haunts her nine years later, as her mind is flooded with memories and regrets when another young girl is missing.Molly experiences the knowing, a form of ESP that gives her clues as to the condition and whereabouts of this little girl. She risks everything--her marriage, credibility, and even her life--to rescue her alive.Pros: This book is very well written. The characters are developed nicely, the storyline is consistent and the pacing is fast and mesmeric. The imagery is fabulous. I could picture the scenes quite clearly. It has been quite some time since I've enjoyed a book this much.Cons: Can't think of a single one.Overall: Highly recommended. I was totally captivated by this story and its characters.

    "reviewText": "As a researcher who has been studying the nature of consciousness and trying to build bridges between the best of science and the best of spirituality for more than 50 years, I was fascinated by Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Near-Death Experience and Journey Into the Afterlife.One of the ways we get new knowledge and refine our knowledge about the spiritual is by listening closely to and working with the accounts of people who have what I will loosely call \"spiritual experiences.\"  In recent decades our culture, e.g., has been strongly affected by previously unheard of familiarity with Near-Death Experiences, NDEs.  When I first began working in psychology 50 years ago, I knew about NDEs because I had read a lot of very esoteric psychical research literature, but aside from knowing that NDEs happened and a few of their characteristics, very little was known by anyone, and the average person had never heard of them.  When Raymond Moody published his Life After Life book on NDEs in 1976 and it hit the bestseller lists (more than 13 million copies sold to 2012!), it resonated with people's spiritual needs, and now there is widespread knowledge about qualities of NDEs.One of the things that most impressed me about people's accounts of their NDEs back then was that people with very different backgrounds and religious beliefs, including people with no formal religious beliefs to speak of, described the qualities of NDEs in a similar way.  But if NDEs were nothing but the distorted functioning of a distressed brain, you would think that, like most hallucinations resulting from brain malfunctions, the content of those hallucinations would be very much affected by a person's life experiences, cultural background, and individual beliefs.  That there was so much commonality immediately made a case that people were telling you about something that might be real in some sense.  By analogy, I have never been to Rome, but accounts I have heard of what Rome looks like by people who claim to have been there show so much commonality that I have high confidence that there really is a place called Rome.From my perspective as a researcher, however, there is a major drawback to collecting more accounts of NDEs today that didn't apply when they were first collected.  Back then, almost everyone who finally came forth with an account noted that they had never heard of such things before they had their own NDE.  Indeed they usually had never talked to anyone about what they had experienced, or had tried to talk to others and been so severely rejected (you must have been hallucinating, that's crazy, the work of the devil, etc., etc.) that they remained silent about it, and so there was very little obvious influence from cultural background or others' opinions creating the similarity in their accounts.  Now there have been so many articles, books, TV specials, etc., about NDEs that when you hear about someone's recent NDE, you have to wonder how much is this an accurate report of something that is \"real\" and how much their experience has been colored by all their previous knowledge about what NDEs are supposed to be about.I am particularly concerned with the potentially biasing effects of previous knowledge because a lot of my early research was on hypnosis, and I had it constantly demonstrated in my research that about a quarter or so of the population could have profoundly real-seeming experiences of any arbitrary nature whatsoever suggested to them by a hypnotist.  I doubt that most NDEs are in this category of the purely arbitrary, all a product of suggestion, even the ones occurring today, but even if a major part of what a person experiences is \"real\" in the sense of belonging to some reality external to their belief system, still the way they perceive it may be influenced to some unknown degree by the now widespread cultural knowledge of what NDEs are supposed to be about.  This doesn't mean there's no point in studying most people's NDEs, just that we have to be careful about this possible biasing factor.  There's nothing particularly novel about this, of course, people's descriptions of ordinary reality are often biased by what they believe, emotions of the moment, etc.So one way of getting a less biased picture of what NDEs are like might be to simply give more weight to experiences collected in the early days of research, when most accounts were from people who had never heard anything about what NDEs were supposed to be about.  Another way of trying to get beyond such a biasing factor is to study more extreme types of NDEs, NDEs with characteristics that are not all that common or known in our culture, and this is a major reason why I find Doctor Eben Alexander's Proof of Heaven  book of great value.  One of the most common features of NDEs established in the early research, for example, was that at some point the person having the NDE, the NDEr, reaches some kind of \"border,\" or \"barrier,\" or \"bridge\" or \"gateway,\" and although they want to go on to what seem even more wonderful heavenly reaches of the experience, they are not allowed to go cross this border or go through this gateway, because if they did, there would be no chance of them returning to physical life.  Sometimes, knowing this, the NDEr chooses to come back to physical life, sometimes he or she is forced to come back to physical life even though they desperately want to go on.What lies beyond this gateway?Doctor Alexander is a neurosurgeon, and he describes a seven days long NDE caused by a usually fatal brain infection that, given our current medical knowledge, we would say totally knocks out all the higher functioning of the brain, everything that makes us conscious human beings.  From the outside medical perspective, he's in a totally unresponsive coma.  Inside, at first he experiences his NDE almost like a vegetative state, with no real thoughts occurring in it, and going on \"forever,\" although no ordinary concept of time or duration meant anything to him in that condition.  And yet eventually he rose above this, with assistance that he perceived in a most interesting way  - -  I won't give away this very thought-provoking aspect of the book  - -  and eventually went through a gateway, and reported  an exceptionally profound experience.Because his experience was exceptionally \"positive,\" a word that hardly begin to convey its power, as a human being I want to believe that his was a true glimpse of the reality of the universe, that we're all under the care of a loving, alive, intelligent universe, like physician Richard M. Bucke reported in his Cosmic Consciousness experience, described in my The End of Materialism: How Evidence of the Paranormal is Bringing Science and Spirit Together.That's my personal reaction, but as a scientist, I have to bracket that reaction.  That is I don't deny it or suppress it, but I recognize that this is something with strong emotions underlying it and it has a possibility of biasing an otherwise relatively objective attempt of mine to understand the experience.  So as a scholar and scientific investigator of NDEs, I look at the content of Doctor Alexander's experience, in so far as he can convey it, note the similarities and differences between some other reports of profound experiences by different people in different times and places (like the Bucke Cosmic Consciousness experience mentioned above, or the Darkness of God experience reported by John Wren-Lewis reported on my TASTE (The Archives of Scientists' Transcendent Experiences) site (go to [...] Collected Archives, and select account number 0051, The Darkness of God), and  - - -  Here's where I'd like to say I understand it's clearly connected to such-and-such phenomena in ways that are very interesting - - -  but I can't yet say much more than that this is really interesting, and I want us to learn a lot more about this kind of thing!  I know, this is the traditional scientific conclusion to almost all reports, \"More research is needed,\" but it's true!  Indeed I would say the implications of NDEs are infinitely more important than 99 percent of what we study in science, so research on NDEs should have an enormous priority in life, but that's not the political reality we live in.  ;-(I also give some extra credence to Doctor Alexander's account because he wasn't a \"believer,\" he wasn't heavily invested in some religious belief system that he had a desperate need to prove.  He had a certain, shallow, conventional religiosity from his family background: going to church on Christmas and Easter, otherwise not really giving religion and spirituality any thought.  He had heard of reports of NDEs, but, like too many physicians, who are closed minded rather than scientific about this area, he dismissed them as nothing but the  hallucinations of a malfunctioning brain.  He wouldn't tell a patient they were crazy if they reported unusual experiences to him: in his role as a doctor, as a healer, he would always be nice to them.  But accounts of NDEs were just noise to him, damaged brain hallucinations.  When he had his own NDE, though, that was something else again!So, moving into book review mode, am I recommending Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife?  Absolutely!  Who am I recommending it to?  Anyone seriously interested in the meaning of life, and anyone willing to try to bracket their own previous beliefs and preconceptions and be very, very stimulated...",

    "reviewText": "Having read a number of \"life after life\" books on near death experiences, I enjoyed the perspective this author brings to the subject as a brain surgeon.  I've had a number of friends and colleagues--a boss, co-worker, mother of a close friend, parent at my school where I worked--have a life after life experience so have heard these accounts in person by people whom I trust.If you are intrigued by how physics, metaphysics, and brain science relates to this experience, this author, as a doctor and scientist who isn't very religious, explains how they related to his 'life after life' episode. It is the first book of this type I have read which connects how quantum physics, science and spirituality mesh in this kind of experience.  I read a lot of metaphysics and some physics and always saw their significance in these near death experiences.  The experience supports quantum physics and spirituality.It's helpful to have the author, as a medical doctor, describe his experience and explain why, in clear scientific and medical language, he believes what he experienced can't be explained merely by neurology or medical science.  His experience gives credibility, to those with an open mind, that there is life after life.If you are looking for long descriptions of what happens in the after-life, you might want more.  There's enough in this book to give you glimpses of it.  There were some original insights in this book I hadn't read elsewhere.  I found this book fascinating, and especially appreciated how a scientific and medical mind reviewed the experience and the conclusions the doctor arrived at in retrospect.  It is a valuable addition to the body of work on this topic.",

As it turns out, I was so completely engrossed in this book that I literally read it in a day, taking breaks only when absolutely necessary. Chasing Amanda caught my attention and didn't let go for 377 pages.Chasing Amanda is the story of Molly Tanner, wife and mom, still trying to stitch her life back together after enduring years of guilt over the abduction of a child named Amanda. Molly witnessed Amanda's abduction, and has spent years beating herself up for not doing more to help the girl. She and her family have since moved to the small town of Boyds, Maryland, to get away from the past and start over. Now, nine years later, another young girl, Tracey, goes missing- and this time, Molly is determined not to let anything get in the way of her helping to find the child- alive.I found myself deeply engrossed in Molly's narrative, and related to the character on an intuitive level. Her concern for this latest lost child goes beyond that of your average neighbor; she is driven to see that she is safe, risking her own safety on several occasions in pursuit of information on the child's whereabouts. The character feels like an old friend early on in the reading.The description of the small town of Boyds is stunningly picturesque. The ambling back roads lined with gorgeous forests are lovely to behold, and easy to hide within. There is so much beauty to distract a person from what is right under her nose.Amazingly, this small town holds several secrets that tie into the disappearance of little Tracey- and it seems that Molly Tanner is the only one willing to connect all the dots.This is a truly entertaining mystery, with a good measure of surprise in store for the patient reader. Don't let yourself get too caught up in trying to figure it all out, though, lest you miss some of the fun of the chase.",

    "reviewText": "It has been a long time since I have read a book that truly held me captive. Chasing Amanda is a very well written book. The story line continuously delves deeper and deeper into a community of people and takes one surprising turn after another. Just when you think you have it figured out, wham! Another twist is revealed. It is not until the end of the book that the entire plot and cast of characters and their hidden secrets are exposed.The book begins with child abduction, one that Molly has had visions of happening. Unable to hone in on the specifics of her vision, she is unable to help the child. Years later, the past seems to be unfolding before her eyes when another child disappears. Even with the risk of destroying her marriage, she is drawn into her visions and her quest to help find the missing child.I began reading the book anticipating a simple storyline - child abducted, woman finds child through visions - but was pleasantly surprised as the story unfolded. The only analogy I can think of to describe Chasing Amanda is to picture the story line as a maze of intertwining vines leading downward to one stalk. There were a lot of surprises and twists and turns and entanglements with one discovery leading to another, each one more surprising than the last.Being quiet in tuned with my own sixth sense (in my own life) I have always been intrigued with books involving the sixth sense. Molly and her son, Eric, share this trait. While sometimes tugging at them, it proves to be a bond between them in the end. It is Eric, who finally convinces Cole, Molly's husband and Eric's father, that the visions are real and that Molly was in need of help.The use of Molly's visions does not consume the book. The book also depicts the difficulties of having special abilities on a family, especially when family members do not want to believe or acknowledge the gift. Molly's marriage is repeatedly pushed to the brink of collapse because of her gift.The loyalty displayed between some of the characters was impressive. It is very hard to find such loyalty and as a person who values loyalty, I appreciated this part of the story line. Chasing Amanda was also a story of understanding our human traits and idiosyncrasies, and learning to respect our differences.I could tell you a lot more about the actual story - but that would spoil the reading of the book. The book blurb tells you enough about the story, I hope my review seals the deal and makes you want to read the book.",

Since both Bryson and, the by now infamous Katz, are middle-aged and out of shape, it gives the reader a good sense of what it really is like to hike it.Bryson does not do anything half-hearted; he has read up extensively on all kinds of facts surrounding the trail - nature, about hiking, the politics of the trail, cultural history, the US as a whole. All journeys have an inner and outer aspect. The outer aspect here is how it is walking the trail and what you expect to encounter along the route. The inner aspect is that he uses the all the facts he has found out about the trail to make it a journey through the US of today. Just this worry that there have been three murders (five when the book is over) along the trail, and they worry about their safety when Katz observes that you can draw a random line through the US and there have been at least three murders along that line!The first part of the book reads like a triumph - they manage to walk and experience nature in all its glory. The second part is more like a descent into hell: Katz deteriorates, and Bryson continues part of the trail on his own. The trail cuts through more \"civilized\" areas up in the north, and there he encounters all the follies of modern man: civil war battlefields, hikers with more gadgets than sense, hikers that defy all description, senseless murders, derelict hotels and resorts, and Centralia. Centralia is something you would expect coming out of the pens of King or Lovecraft, not something that actually exists!Bryson can be very sarcastic and cynical at times. I think that that is the curse of the very kind and intelligent man he is (I have met him) - he is very distraught by the idiocy of his fellow men.",

    "reviewText": "Chasing Amanda by Melissa Foster is a five star story. It is an emotional read, and has a very clear message- get involved when something seems out of place. The protagonist Molly tries to undue a wrong she thought she had made years prior. The abduction of a small child-would haunt her and her family for years. She believes what the man has told her; that his daughter was screaming and flailing around in his car because she `didn't get the doll she wanted', but that wasn't the case. Molly is racked with guilt and turns her attention into high gear when another little girl goes missing in their new town.  She's clairvoyant, but gets very little help from the authorities, and she's shrouded in doubt. The characters are memorable, and some are very rare and uniquely odd to say the least.  The story was chilling at times, and made you grasp onto your own feelings on crimes against children. How easy it is to brainwash a child into trusting a stranger. It also contains a mystery that isn't solved until the end. Very well written and my mind was full of ideas on how it would end. I almost wanted to read the last chapter, which is rare for me, just to find out the ending. It was a touching and sensitive tale that had me on an emotional roller-coaster. Melissa does an excellent job of bringing out the personalities, temperaments and qualities of each character in the book. I would definitely recommend, Chasing Amanda. Laura Helland/Stolmeier",

His audience from the Prologue:\"I am especially eager to tell my story to the people who might have heard stories similar to mine before and wanted to believe them, but had not been able to fully do so.\"I am not one of his intended audience since I'm very familiar with NDEs from Moody and others and belong to the scientific/mystic group. Scientific and Religious dogmatists (skeptics) will find no solace in his wonderful story.He tells his story simply and eloquently. I particularly enjoyed his observations about the difference between having/being an experience and being able to explain that experience to others. Kinda like stuffing a million pounds of sugar into a teaspoon. Or as a friend put: \"You can know what you think, but you can't think what you know.\" Thought as a symbolic representation in language is an experience, yet not the same as the originating experience.Additionally, at the end of Ch 28 Dr. Alexander writes:\"...I had been alive, and aware, truly aware, in a universe characterized above all by love, consciousness, and reality.\"This \"love, consciousness, and reality\" is a restatement in his words of his experience of the ancient Sanskrit concept/experience of \"Sat-Chit-Ananda\": Existence-Consciousness-Bliss.Dr. Alexander, with his story, adds himself to a growing list of scientists who propound the truth of Science and Spirituality as two non-dichotomous aspects of the same reality.I do differ from him wrt \"Evil\", in the sense of my experience of: \"All there is, is Love. If you are not experiencing Love, you are deluded.\" Thus I see \"Evil\" merely as \"Delusion\", and, still another aspect of Love.For me, the last chapter held a special joy and beauty.Finally, thank you Dr. Alexander for sharing your magnificent story with the world. You, we, are the reason.Om Prema, Mahalo Nui Loa, and Aloha.. Al",

Its basically a story of a physician's journey into the spiritual plane of the otherworld and back while near death in a septic coma and how that experience has changed his worldview.  I've never had an NDE but I've had mystical experiences and it gives me joy to have more evidence that our consciousness continues after death. This book doesn't conform to the biblical description of what heaven is like, so the title may be misleading for Christians. This book is well suited for people interested in consciousness subjects {e.g. NDEs, astral projection, sensory deprivation...) and transpersonal experiences and may help people see above materialism and scientific reductionism. Hopefully it will help alter our collective behavior as a society for the better if more people realize that there is more to our life that this short time on earth.",

    "reviewText": "I have to admit when I began to read this story I had high expectations. The author had received many favorable reviews, awards, and was heavily marketing the book through various social media. I don't recall whether I actually purchased the book or got it free through a promotion but because it was a fellow twitter user and author, I committed myself, without telling the author, to reviewing it when I finished.I am a big believer in supporting other writers and this is one way I try to show my support. Reviews are a vital part of that support but when a book doesn't work for you, how do you find the words to kindly put that? By the time I was halfway finished with the book, I was so disappointed I didn't know what to say in a review. By the time I finished it, I was left with a feeling of disappointment so strong it saddened me that such a great story had fallen so short of its full potential. It took reading other reviews that said essentially the same things I had thought of that made me realize I too, needed to share my thoughts, for better or for worse. My grandmother always taught me \"If you have nothing nice to say, it's best to say nothing at all.\" Sorry, Grandma, I'm going to have to disagree with you there.There is little doubt that the author has creativity. The story's premise drew me in immediately. Molly lives a quiet life - a typical mother, wife, and friend until one ordinary day she witnesses a little girl being loaded into a vehicle, screaming. It isn't until a few days later when she realizes the little girl had been kidnapped then murdered and she did nothing to stop it. Eventually Molly and the family move to a small rural town in an effort to leave the past and its painful memories behind, only to have it follow, putting everything they've rebuilt together at risk. Molly has to not only find herself again, but has to find the strength to stand up for who she now is, which is drastically different from who she was and at the strong risk of losing her marriage and her sanity, which she fought so hard to keep.The story premise itself is a powerful one, with which any mother could identify. Unfortunately, this book is in desperate need of some editorial assistance. There are areas throughout the book which are very confusing to the reader, enormous sections of unnecessary descriptions that I admit I skipped over often, and an excessive amount of internal monologue of largely dramatic inner musings and fears for the lead character. In addition, the author spends almost as much time \"telling\" as any other aspect of the book - every thought and emotion is told rather than shown through dialogue or actions by the characters. Possibly the worst area however is the dialogue, which in places, is downright embarrassing and I cringed anytime Molly and her husband began arguing. Her husband was downright hateful with almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever, to the point where I wondered how the character could possibly survive being married to this man (and whether any of this was personal experience for the author). For a time I even thought maybe the husband was responsible for the kidnapping because he was so vehemently opposed to her getting involved.It's obvious to this reader that the author has a great deal of potential but after having read a portion of Megan's Way and all of Chasing Amanda, I suggest a consultation with a solid editor, writing mentor, a writing program or all of the above. Write by Night could possibly do a great deal to help as well, they've certainly been helping me with my work. Paying an editor to help this story and any others in the future is a must. With revision and tightening, this story could really be improved and stand a shot at being a true award winning bestseller. Or maybe it's just not a good fit for me. Stephanie Meyer has certainly done well and I couldn't read more than a few pages of her books.*This is not intended to be hurtful to the author or fans of the work. It is my opinion, is shared as such, and is free to use or ignore without consequence.*",

This book is about Jack Coughlin, not Carlos Hathcock.  Carlos, even though he is no longer with us, is the REAL top-ranked Marine sniper.  Sadly, the book goes down hill from here.Snipers, like all other real special operations personnel, are quiet professionals who do not boast and brag about their duties.  Coughlin tries to make the reader believe that if it were not for him and his daring exploits, the war would be lost. I get the impression that this guy has some serious self-esteem problems and tries to compensate for them by loudly beating the drum of macho self-importance.  His ego would not fit into a C-5 cargo plane.It's easy to see why Marines would be insulted by this book. Coughlin downplays their enormous contributions and sacrifices and makes them appear less than able. The Marines get in trouble and call upon their guardian angel to save them.  What crap. Making matters worse is that this book seems to have been written at a 6th or 7th grade level.If you want a good book about the war, read \"Darkside:The Road to Baghdad.\"  If you want an outstanding book about a Marine sniper, read \"Marine Sniper,\" the story of Carlos Hathcock.I do not wish to suggest that this book has no redeeming value.  On the contrary, it should be issued to all military personnel.  This way, when they are out in the field and run out of toilet paper..............",

What it turned out to be is a seething rant about how the author hates nature and it is all he can stand to simply walk through the woods. I really doubt that much of this book is even true, at least the hiking parts anyway. Clearly the author's knowledge about nature and hiking comes primarily from only reading about it, as his obvious paranoid fear of anything that is outside of city limits shines through in this book. I don't think he could tolerate even an afternoon on the AT, let alone what he claims to have done in this book.This book just reads with a very smug tone, and I really didn't like how he completely insulted and picked apart practically everyone he encountered in the book (not to their face, of course). He also does a lot of stereotyping of Southerners, hikers, small town people, and again, pretty much everyone he encounters. The guy is just a jerk at heart.I just noticed too, that the bear on the cover is a brown bear, which doesn't even live in the area he supposedly hiked.

Dr. Alexander attempts to reach out to all of us, yet he uses language few people will A, understand and B, care about. I am certainly not uneducated. I have a bit higher than average intelligence, yet I got lost in all the mumbo-jumbo technicality of this book.We hear very little of the actual experience of being on the Other Side because this book is more about Alexander's trying to convince us it happened, and using a very disappointing way of trying to accomplish that.Most people would have no clue what he's talking about nor, again, would they care.He could have given us the technical/medical reasons for why his \"adventure\" couldn't possibly be a hoax from a medical standpoint on a mere 2-3 pages. The rest is rambling nonsense.No matter what he says here, I'm going with the fact that lots of drugs were involved and what truly happens to us in coma combined with large amounts of pharmaceuticals, no one, not even the best, most intelligent physician or scientist can explain for certain... they can only give their opinion... and that's what this book is about, Dr. Alexander's opinion.

    "reviewText": "I have been reading a series of autobiographical accounts of modern day warriors and had high hopes for this title.  As others have pointed out, Coughlin's ego can be suffocating at times.  This could be forgiven if it were the books only flaw.  Alas it is not.  The writing is amateurish at best and the author's overuse of adjective and hyperbole is very distracting.  The language is disjointed and unnatural as if it were written with the heavy use of a thesaurus.  Again this could be forgiven as we're reading this book for a soldier's account, not that of an English grad student.This book offers a stark contrast in comparison with Nathaniel Fick's \"One Bullet Away.\"  Whereas Fick seems to be an intelligent, thoughtful and humble warrior whose primary concern is the welfare of his men, Coughlin conveys himself as a shallow intellect with more concern for personal glory and satisfaction than anything else.  He is a team player when he hand picks the team and considers them worthy of his own company.You cannot know a person from reading their writing but Coughlin's character development is very superficial.  His attempts to convey a \"human side\" are unbelievable and seem grossly contrived.  This is a great contrast to the character development in \"One Bullet.\"  There is no connection between author and reader in \"Shooter.\"  Coughlin does not develop the role players either.  In \"One Bullet\" you really feel the brotherhood developed among the officer, his NCOs and the enlisted men.  Additionally, Coughlin's demeaning descriptions of his support staff (non-trigger pullers) is tedious and only reinforces doubts about his team ethic.To make matters worse the action isn't as well developed as in other titles.  The author's self-congratulatory tone and emphasis on personal exploits, with plenty of after-action chest thumping, obscures the view of battle.  He spends little time on the finer elements of sniper tradecraft, training and shooting.  This can be found elsewhere.Overall this book was a great disappointment.  If only a fraction of Coughlin's self-acclaimed exploits are true, then he is a remarkable sniper.  He should let his accomplishments speak for themselves and not try to beat us over the head with them.",

I'm not discounting that he might have actually experienced something spiritual while in his coma, but I do not believe that what he experienced was from or about God.  I believe he was deceived by whatever entity might have been influencing his mind and spirit during that coma.I would not recommend this book to anyone who is a Christian, as you will most likely be sorely disappointed by it.

No unit commander or Scout/Sniper team leader would allow these things to happen. They have no tactical value and would be down right fatal to someone who tried. There is no such thing as the lone sniper anymore in the Marine Corps we always work as a team of two at the very minimum. We live by simple rules always \"ONE IS NONE, TWO IS ONE\". With this as a base fundamental for a Marine Sniper and all other Snipers in the Service. Confirmed kills started in Vietnam and ended shortly after it was a way for commanders to verify what snipers were claiming, as in enemy killed, it required searching of each and every person you killed. As for a ranking system for snipers in the Marine Corps I have never heard of one. Snipers are viewed as a team never as individualsHogs in the Shadows: Combat Stories from Marine Snipers in Iraqyour team was successful never the individual.

    "reviewText": "Did this lost soul deliberately ignore the shadows behind the brilliant production he describes or did the characters in this perfect heaven successfully pull the wool over his eyes? On reaching the end of this unsatisfactory book, I found myself asking again and again: where is the \"as above, so below\" aspect? Many overlook that this also means: as below, so above.I absolutely agree with the other 1-star reviews of this book. Not only is there very little about heaven here (less than 20 out of the 200+ pages) but the author provides no proofs whatsoever - of anything. I'm astonished at over 850 glowing reviews - I can only guess that these are the same people who raved about the Ringing Cedars series of immoral fairytales.Eventually I understood: what this poor man experienced was a show, just like a musical but a much better production, as it engaged all the senses. In order to make something appear so perfect, others have to be working really hard in the background. The angelic characters he describes are either faking it (just like actors) or are heavily into denial.What he perceived is a bit like finding yourself on a perfect island resort: white-sand beaches, swaying palm trees, a gentle breeze, singing birds, lush greenery on the hillsides and clear turquoise water, lapping waves, beautiful corals and tropical fish. You can have a wonderful time with clean, ironed sheets every day and great food only because badly paid drudges living in slums are doing the dirty work.If you've read this far and are puzzled, I recommend the \"Right Use of Will\" series, which goes into detail about the parts (inside us as well as reflected outside of us) that have been judged against, controlled, disciplined, punished and denied - the seamy underside of heaven. If heaven was truly so perfect, there is no way they would leave billions to rot in the hell we have allowed to be created here while just a few thousand wear couture and, dripping in jewelery, travel by private plane to their mansions in different parts of the world - all run by slaves (anyone who MUST work is a slave) - while also heavily denying their sordid contributions to the seamy underside of the world they live in.",

    "reviewText": "I expected much more from this book. I didn't expect the author to preach semi-liberal views and disrespect our leaders like Donald Rumsfeld. Several times throughout the book he second-guesses Rumsfeld and basically openly disses him, which to me is not proper for a military officer.Another one of his ideologies that blew me away was \"Fight fair when outnumbered eight to one? F(expletive) that.\" (p 68  He almost pays tribute to the current insurgency who seem to have thrown all the rules of war out the window. Carlos Hathcock seemed to have more integrity with regards to the honor of war. And as Rush says, \"Only liberals fight dirty\".The last straw was how he whined about his own failure as a father. Now I know a lot of liberals don't exactly support Dr. Laura Schlessinger, but come on folks. Coughlin left his kids time and time again during their most impressionable ages in order to pursue his career and his 'adventures'. That is fine if you are single. But once you have kids you need to raise them right. And he even writes about deciding to have his second child after he knew his marriage was going downhill. Those poor kids have to live with that reality, a distant, absent father during their most important years. That type of parenting frequently leads to pushing the kids towards homosexuality.I expected todays soldiers to be more mature and see the importance of family values. The days of pursueing self-glory and narcissistic excitement should be left to the dead-end liberals, not soldiers.The only time he seemed to stray from his subtle liberal political agenda was when he rightly linked Sadaam and Iraq to the brutal attacks on 9/11: \"My personal viewpoint had only hardened since the terrible attacks of 9/11 ... I considered Iraq a logical target\". (p 65)",

    "reviewText": "The title of this book is very misleading.  There are several problems and logical errors with the author's claim that his experience is proof of heaven. First, he may be sure he experienced all he said, but if he had brain damage (or even if he didn't) even he can't know, let alone us, how accurate the recollections are. Second, even if we stipulate that his recollections during the coma are all accurate, major problems remain.  A. He presents no rigorous data to document his claim that his cortical brain was entirely dead during the coma. Where are the scans, read-outs, etc demonstrating this? If he did not want to include this in the text, it could have been included in an index. After his claims depend on this claim being 100% verified, yet all we have to go on is his word. B. He argues, again without presenting rigorous evidence,that the \"lower\" (non cortex) parts of his brain could not produce or contrinute anything like \"conscious perceptions.\" But even his use of that phrase is misleading, since his \"heavenly\" experiences were obviously not conscious ones any normal sense, but surreal, other-worldly ones reminiscent of hallucinations. C. Even if his cortex were completely non-functioning during the coma, and even if his lower brain was uninvolved during the coma as well, there must have been times while he was going into the coma, and later recovering before coming out of the coma, when his cortex was partial functioning. Please grasp this critical point. He himself admits he had no way to judge time or how much of it passed while he was \"out\" so it is entirely possible, if not likely, that he experienced what he did while he was coming out of the coma, and his brain was impaired, but partially functioning. Indeed, he presents several known and plausible ways people can have NDEs due to brain impariments.  Oddly, he dismisses all of the explanations in HIS case on the grounds that his experience was too complex and \"real\" to have been produced by a \"dead\" brain cortex.  However, the fact that he recovered and had little if any brain damage (other than not always thinking logically) suggests his brain not totally dead even during the midst of the coma. And again, he ignores the critical point that there had to be points on either end when it was partly functioning. His neglect of that crucial point causes his whole thesis to fall apart. His credibility would also have been improved, and suspicions of bias or exaggeration (and conflict of interest) removed, if he had donated the proceeds of his book to charity. But again, for the reasons just noted, even if he is 100% sincere, the logical flaws in his \"proof\" make it far from that.",

    "reviewText": "I wanted to like this book. I wanted to believe it. The author seems so sincere. Who would not like to think that there is something beautiful beyond death, that there is nothing to fear, that we can do no wrong and we will be unconditionally loved? Yet, my determination was severely tested by the author's presentation. When Eben Alexander describes his (NDE) Near Death Experience, in 2008, brought on when he descended into a coma from a rare form of an e-Coli Virus,from which there was little hope of his recovery, he fills his tale with a rather large view of himself. He often apologizes for this, but kind of arrogance is, nevertheless, ever present. I felt as if he believed someone had elected him to the top post, to sit at the right hand of G-d. His explanations were often too technical or needed to be accepted based on his word or blind faith. Because he is a man of science, he came with good credentials, but the book left me wanting more. I needed some substance and the book felt thin in that department. If people coming out of comas go into psychotic states, hallucinating, why is it not possible for them to go into a psychotic state and also hallucinate entering into it? If scientifically it is impossible when the Neo Cortex is compromised completely, perhaps the science is wrong. Surely we know little enough about the brain and how it works to simply believe that what he experienced was real and not a dream state of some kind. He had been unhappy in prior years. His family life and professional life had suffered. He was adopted and was unsuccessfully searching for his roots, until a recent contact with a sister proved somewhat fruitful, and he learned of other siblings. He learned that his parents had married and he had a sister who had died. Perhaps his NDE was merely wish fulfillment, on his end.When describing his NDE , he speaks of the Realm of The Earthworm's-Eye View, a place of misery, The Gateway, a place of celestial beauty, where he met the beautiful girl on the butterfly's wing, and The Core, where he felt communion with a greater being, where he felt close to the Creator, to Om, to G-d, to Jesus. Although he justifies the validity of his experience with claims that these are concepts that are new to him, it seemed doubtful to me, a non-Christian, so how could it not be so to him, even if he was not a religious Christian at that time? Are those concepts not universally reminiscent of Heaven, Hell, Purgatory and/or Limbo?Eben realized, as an adoptee, that he had always somehow felt abandoned, unloved and when he thought about his NDE, he wondered why he was the only documented case of a person who had an NDE that had not been aware of who he was, during the experience, and the only one who had not met anyone who had died during his life who would lead him through and comfort him, as others had. Why had his father not come to comfort him, to tell him everything was all right; he had not been able to please him and he wanted his forgiveness. These thoughts reinforced his feelings of abandonment. He began to question the legitimacy of his own experience.When he was still a doubter, in 2008, shortly after his recovery, he went to church and was asked to light an advent candle. Walking up, the music and scenes and sights before him seemed more beautiful than they had in the past, and he was overwhelmed. Since his illness, it would seem that this environment had more meaning for him, and he was brought to tears. The experience evoked memories of his NDE. Eben began to realize that we are so much more than our physical bodies. Still unsure of himself, there was one final act that convinced him he should spread the word about his experience in order to enlighten the world. As a scientist, he believed his word would be more credible than the word of others who had had similar experiences. So when he received a picture of a deceased sister, sent to him by his biological sister he realized she looked oddly familiar. Soon he realized, the last piece of the puzzle had fallen into place. He had met someone he knew. The girl on the butterfly wing in her angelic form was, he believed, his dead sister. He had been reading a book by Elizabeth Kubler Ross in which a young girl relates a NDE to her dad and explains that she met her brother, but she had no brother...her father confessed that a few months before she was born, her brother had died. This revelation about his own dead sibling, gave him renewed hope and faith in his own NDE.Eben believes that consciousness resides some place other than the brain. Paraphrasing, he says, \"we live in the dimension of the familiar, but the grander universe is here, now, with us, in a different frequency.\" He believes you don't have to die to access this frequency, \"to access the truths behind the veil\", you just have to learn how, but don't try to hard, for that will defeat you. Meditation is a useful tool. To understand the grander universe, you have to be part of it, become one with it.\"Eben himself admits that his experiences are very hard to describe and it is evident in his writing which is unclear, at times. I found that there was too much information, too technical at times, but there were not enough facts to make it credible. He says his experience in the Core was greater than his ability to understand it, to put into words, that he was able to absorb knowledge at a faster rate, immediately understand things that would take months, even years in ordinary time. In this place, time didn't matter. So, although he couldn't explain it, are we to accept his explanation and beliefs on blind faith? Why was he chosen to pass on this message? I thought the connections he made could be coincidence rather than providential. He had been scientific in his thinking, but now he was more spiritual.Eben wrote that the Creator allows evil to exist because we have free will, but who is the Creator? He says we are all part of the divine, part of G-d, who is all loving and forgiving. He says the divine is always with us, and our job is to grow toward the divine. If we are all part of this G-d, this OM, then who is it or what is it? I have trouble with blind faith. The book feels too Christian in its concepts to be universally accepted. I believe Eben is being a bit presumptuous when he assumes we can all achieve this divine state. Can Jews or Muslims, or Budhists or Hindus achieve this state without disavowing their own faiths?After his experience, he founded ETERNA, a non-profit organization to serve the greater good, to advance research into spiritually transformative experiences. The organization offers comfort and spiritual guidance to those going through difficult times with illness, etc. (Eben believes that you have to earn your entry into the higher planes of the realm he visited. Perhaps, he wants to earn his own by being G-dlike, good and compassionate.)There simply was no PROOF OF HEAVEN, for me. The pieces fell into place, all too conveniently. However, I encourage other readers to draw their own conclusions. Your own background may alter your view and you may find greater inner peace than I did, when you read about what happened to him from the onset of his illness to the time of his recovery and then also learn a bit about his past. As a physician, he also has checkered history which warrants investigation. Perhaps this is all about Alexander's need for love, compassion and forgiveness. He believes, from his NDE, he learned that everyone is loved, they have nothing to fear, and they can do no wrong. That is the strongest message he received. That is also his strongest need, so perhaps it was his own wish fulfillment during his coma, rather than an \"other worldly\" experience. At the end of the day, though, do we all have to be Christians to have this experience, to attain this afterlife?I have told little about his experiences, so the reader may draw their own conclusions as they read the book.",

When I look at myself I am smaller than a grain of sand and yet when I call on the Lord he always comes through.

You get a first hand account of what hiking the AT really entails (discomfort, hunger, dampness, fear, loathing, joy, satisfaction, exhaustion..)and plenty of interesting history to bolster what you are &quot;seeing&quot; as you make your way along the trail. This is life on the Appalachian Trail and Bryson brings it to us with verve and wit. Yes, he and his buddy Steve are over weight and out of shape but that doesn't stop them. And neither does meeting obnoxious people on the trail. There's Mary Ellen for a start, fascinating as a multi car pile up. It's nasty but you can't look away. (Bill and Steve graciously put up with her way longer than I would have.) As for stealing shoe laces from another hiker's boots who showed a gross lack of trail etiquette or consideration for anyone else?  I would have taken the boots!! But all these details aside, Bill Bryson has a keen wit that will sustain through the highs and lows of his hike. He'll make you want to go out and buy all the gear and go hike the trail.

Actually, I don't believe there were as many 1-2 Star Reviews when I bought this book a few months back as there are now. But maybe I just never noticed them.After finishing Chasing Amanda, I went back to read the reviews again, and I couldn't believe I'd read the same book as all those 4-5 Star Reviewers.  How on earth did this book win the 2011 Reader's Favourite Award?This novel needed more skilled writing and a good editor.  I have numerous issues with the story, but the main ones are:The plot was clumsy with too many over-detailed extraneous subplots thrown in as filler.  I love a good mystery and to be kept guessing, but a reader shouldn't feel confused and uncertain after the mystery is revealed.  In addition, I felt the \"secrets\" were actually a little boring and undramatic.A quarter of the way through Chasing Amanda, I noticed the meandering plot contained a lot of repetition of the same scenarios, situations and internal/external dialogues.  It began to seem pointless and tedious.The voices of all the characters were written exactly the same, with no differentiation, from seven year-old Tracey, to teenaged Eric, to 40-somethings Molly and Cole and right on up to the \"old\" mid-50's Pastor Lett & Hannah.I like paranormal fiction as well as mysteries but the \"Knowing\" of our obsessed protagonist, Molly, seemed more like hysteria.Now, on to Molly.....in spite of her previous psychological trauma revolving around the Amanda situation and for all her good intentions, I would describe Molly as shallow, emotionally unstable, narcissistic, obstinate, reckless, irrational and unthinking.  Not really a likeable character you can relate to, unless you like bi-polar protagonists.  I don't think that's what the author had in mind.Molly's behaviour is fuelled by her obsession and she suffers from huge emotional swings, which aren't believably written.  She overreacts to her husband and the police doubting her unpredictable psychic powers, for which she offers perfunctory proof. Her unbelievably rash and dangerous actions would appear very suspicious to the police and she has no care about compromising the investigation into Tracey's abduction.Other reviewers disliked her husband, Cole, and thought he wasn't supportive of her.  In view of how often he tried to reason and reconcile with her, I really couldn't fault him for being protective of her and concerned for her safety.  Their unrealistic relationship (as evidenced by their badly-written dialogue) seemed contrived to elicit sympathy for Molly.  In fact, Molly was secretive, argumentative and stubborn and never took his advice or counsel when offered.There are too many psychics, too many children held underground and too many secrets in this book.  The plot, and especially the ending, is a mishmash of a bunch of ideas all thrown in together.I was shocked at the 60% point with the introduction of ghosts to the story; by 80% I was skimming to get to the end (especially the religious passages); and when at the 95% point new characters and a new subplot are introduced I was speechless.From now on, I vow to myself to read the reviews more closely and be more discriminating in my Kindle choices.  Chasing Amanda was a disappointment for me and quite possibly one of the worst books I've read in a long while.",

The queen, according to Miles, is obsessed with various men and their bodies and jeopardizes her kingdom in order to impress them. The tense and viewpoint frequently jump back and forth, and Miles muddles the various characters and lords of Elizabeth's kingdom to such an extent that half the time you have no idea who you are reading about--just that yet someone else has been killed.The dialogue seemed to come almost straight from the film \"Elizabeth\" and \"Elizabeth:The Golden Age\"--to such an extent that I was literally shocked. There are no references whatsoever in the book; the plot of Elizabeth's life is handled so poorly that I found myself slogging through the novel just to say I had finished it.The entire thing was 600+ pages of pure torture for me and will be for those who are well read and can recognize who is a good author and who is not.

In fact, I disliked the main character so much that I never made it past the second chapter.  Top it off with poor writing (misused words and typos, not to mention very flat and boring) and it was too much.  I am just glad that I only paid 99 cents for the thing.  I took it off of my Kindle....I will have to be VERY bored to try reading it again!  I cannot believe this book won any kind of award....",

I feel no connection with his event. Every other chapter he goes into his spiritual assent, and personality none of it touched me as being true. A deep unmovable truth.I also didn't even feel personally close to his family or his relationships. Something seemed very arrogant to me about his life and his relationships seemed empty.

    "reviewText": "The reason this kind of rubbish gets published is that it sells. And it sells because people want to read about heaven in the hope that heaven really exists and that they some day (but not quite yet) might get there. The book &#8220;Heaven is for real&#8221; published in 2010 sold over one million copies and is still #2 on the best selling list of religious books &#8211; far out selling the King James Bible.Proof of Heaven, a copy cat copy of Heaven is for real, published in 2012 is still up there - #1 in religion (yes, #1 as of last week) and #119 among over 10 million books. Heaven  might not be real but the money made from writing about Heaven is real.About the medicine in Proof of Heaven: The Glasgow Coma score, we are told, was 8 out of 15. The author claims that 8 means severe. That is not true. That is a moderate score, not severe. Severe is 3 to 7. Moderate is 8 to 12. Mild is 13 or better. The details are not listed but from his behavior he has to have at least a 4 on motor (withdraws) and a 3 on verbal (said God, help me), leaving a 1 on eyes, meaning the eyes do not open at all and yet even when he was in the ICU the eyes did open on their own -  a 4. That 4 on eyes would bring his score up to 11. Conclusion: he exaggerated his score to make his condition look more serious that it was. Other exaggerations include his statement that his cortex and brain were destroyed. The recovery proves they were not. His statement that meningitis primarily involves the cortex is not true. Meningitis primarily involves the meninges, the connective tissues surrounding and protecting the brain, and that is why it is called meningitis. The CAT scan showed just that &#8211; swelling of the meninges. Cortex was OK. He also tries to make a big deal about the spinal fluid sugar being so low at 20. Every patient that I have taken care of with meningitis, including patients with TB meningitis and Syphilitic meningitis and Torula meningitis, has had a spinal sugar of zero and has made a complete recovery with treatment. His sugar of 20 is low but not as bad as he would like us to think. In fact, a sugar of 20 in this clinical setting would favor recovery, which is what happened.You may have noticed that nowhere in his book does he mention his electroencephalogram. How come? I think the EEG showed electrocortical activity and that would have thrown his case for complete cortical brain destruction right out the window. I bet the EEG showed activity and it would be interesting to know if it showed REM (rapid eye movement sleep) because that is what I think he had - a dream of heaven, nothing more. By the way, even if the EEG showed no activity that would only mean it showed no activity. It would not mean the brain was dead or destroyed. I took care of a young woman who was in real coma (Coma scale 3) for six weeks. Her EEG on repeated tests showed no activity and yet she woke up and recovered completely. That miracle occurred because of all my hard work keeping her alive with management of infections, electrolytes, nutrition and so forth.The psychology of the author is a classical study of what may happen when people do not feel loved. He admits that he didn&#8217;t feel loved and he knows it is because of the resentment he has toward his natural 16 year old unwed mother who abandoned him. Multiple studies in humans and animals show that lack of mothering during early infancy may lead to psychological problems in adulthood. He admits that that is true in his case. His feeling of not being loved (he tells us) played a role in his alcohol problem and his depression and slumping of his academic neurosurgical career (page 57), both of which led to &#8220;lost years (page 163)&#8221; during which he did not function normally. His solution to the lack of love problem is his discovery that he is loved by the spirit that created the entire universe. Rejected by his real parents, he was accepted by God. Furthermore, the author is obviously someone very specially favored by the great spirit because as he says, &#8220;I was granted full access to the cosmic being that I really am. I was allowed to die harder, and travel deeper, than all NDE (near death experience) subjects before me.&#8221; How the hell does he know that for sure?But the real question is does this book prove the existence of heaven. To prove something you need evidence. The evidence has to be relevant and adequate. The evidence of one person sick with meningitis is not adequate. It is not enough evidence in kind, quality, number, or weight to prove anything. A more natural explanation is that he had a dream that he still thinks was real. Me too. I have dreamed that I made love to Raquel Welch. My dream was super real until I woke up in a pile of goo.Notice that his dream of heaven had a beautiful woman in it. She is blond and beautiful and she understands and loves him without hesitation or reservation. That is the classical male dream, the dream of the unknown woman who loves and understands the dreamer. A dream is a wish that the heart makes when you are asleep.On the basis of probability, the existence of an afterlife is very remote. The dead don&#8217;t come back. Before his death, my father promised me that if there was anything on the other side, he would come back and tells me. My father never went back on his word. His silence on this issue tells a lot. And how probable is it that the great creator of all things, the spirit that made the 100 billion stars in the milky way and 100 billion known galaxies,  would choose only very sick people on this very small planet to reveal heaven. If God wanted us to know about heaven why can&#8217;t he just arrive on a white cloud and make an announcement on all the TV and radio stations.During his illness Dr. Alexander believed that his doctors and his wife Holley were trying to kill him. He believed he was flying. He believed he was sky diving. He believed the Florida police were chasing him. He believed ninja photographers were on cable pulleys (what?). How come we are so ready to admit that those delusions were crazy? How come so many people are not ready to admit that his heaven thing is also a delusion and just as crazy?",

    "reviewText": "If only Eben Alexander had titled his book \"I Believe.\" He happens to be aneurosurgeon. His profession is irrelevant to his experience, and yet he hangs his whole story on it, as if to lend it credibility.  The same story should be able to be told by a car salesman, with the same weight.The story is quite simple. The patient contracted a horrendous bacterial meningitis and was unconscious for almost a week. He came out of a coma with a recall of visions and experiences that he says could not have been dreamed because the thinking parts of his brain were \"totally offline.\" This, he says, proves that his remembrances were not dreams but rather real events that happened out of his brain and body. In fact he calls them not reality but \"ultra-reality.\"But in fact, no one knows when those visions occurred or where. Dr. Alexander wants to believe -- and wants everyone to believe -- they occurred out of his body and out of his mind.  I started the book with an open mind of my own. But in some of the first pages, when I read his statement that \"What I have to tell you is as important as anything anyone will ever tell you, and it's true,\" I was struck a bit dumb by the enormous presumption of that claim.He also claims he \"was allowed to die harder\" than almost all near death experience subjects before him. How also would he know that? And how did he \"die harder\" when he did not die?This is a faith-based book. Dr. Alexander reports that God is love and God is everywhere. This is hardly breaking news in any community of faith. Maybe it was news to him.\"Proof of Heaven\" is an outrageous title for a book that has become quite the rage.",

    "reviewText": "I just finished Eban Alexander's book Power of Heaven. Do yourselves a favor and do not buy it. I had heard him interviewed on Terry Gross's Fresh Air Program about his Near Death Experience, surviving a coma for 7 days after flat-lining medically. His brain died. He is an MD and a neurosurgeon who has taught at Harvard, among other places, so he seemed legitimate. Poor Terry Gross never got around to or mentioned the malpractice suits against Dr. Alexander, so we were never told about his checkered background. The interview led me to believe that Alexander is serious about researching NDE experiences now that more people than ever survive heart attacks, comas, lightning strikes, etc, where the brain has died. In fact, he went on at length about how he is designing experiments to test commonalities of these experiences. In the interview, Dr. Alexander was most impressive.Unfortunately, aside from the description of his experiences while brain dead (?), there is nothing else to be found in this book except a lot of maudlin sentimentality and narcissism. The book is all about the author's \"unique\" knowledge of the afterlife, and how very fortunate we are to have him alive to show us the way. The author has such a bump on himself it is hard to read his book. I kept waiting for him to describe his scientific research, but there is nothing there! Shirley Maclaine was writing the same stuff 30 years ago, but she never pretended to be a scientist!Don't buy this book. It is being hyped as the missing link to scientific validation of the spiritual realm, but truly, as they say in Texas, this book is all hat and no cattle.",

    "reviewText": "The title of the book Proof of Heaven by Eben Alexander is not designed to provide information regarding content of the book.  Rather the title Proof of Heaven is designed to prey upon the potential audience the author is seeking in order sell the book and I do not think I am overstating my opinion by stating his likely real calling is used car salesman.  (my apology to ucs; don't mean to be insulting.)I bought the book on a recommendation from a palliate care doctor in my role as Health Care Director to a family member.  Dying patients and their family and friends are no doubt some of those that this book targets as part of the author's potential audience (prey).Half way through I thought to myself as Inquiring Mind stated in her/his review (read too late of course) \"is this a Narcissistic Personality Disorder?\"  Possibly but most certainly \"well let's see how we can sell this book?\"  \"Ahh ha, let's call it Proof of Heaven. That'l sell.\"In Proof of Heaven the author stated that he took his son's advise and wrote down all of his recollections of his NDE or experiences in Heaven prior to reading any of the literature on the subject in order not to be influenced by anything he might read on NDE.  The author claims to have done exactly this.  However, prior to my having come to that part of the book where the author makes that statement I kept wondering why the word \"Gateway\" he was using as his abbreviation for Gates of Heaven sounded like it came straight out of Robert Monroe's Gateway Hemi-Sync workshops at the Monroe Institute in Faber, Virginia.The NDE the author is referring to occurred in November, 2008.  He went through the Gateway Voyager program at the Monroe Institute in 2011.  His book Proof of Heaven was published in 2012.  NO, NONE, ZIP, NADA, ZERO, to my knowledge, of those people associated with the Monroe Institute has endorsed this book. Nor is the publisher of many of the authors who are associated with the Monroe Institute, Hampton Roads, the publisher of Proof of Heaven. (See page 175 paperback edition where one entire page of a three page Acknowledgements section is devoted to the praise of various persons associated with the Gateway Hemi-Cync and the Monroe Institute).  Use of the word Gateway seems to suggest that most if not all the author's recollections were derived, interpreted, likely imagined after his coma and therefore the critical question of experience while in a coma are entirely irrelevant.The malpractice suits against Dr. Alexander are relevant here not so much for having performed surgery at the wrong sites on, I think, 3 different occasions but rather that he tried to cover up and hide what he had done which brought the charge of ethics into the malpractice suits.  It is one thing to make mistakes (geez 3 times) but to lie to the patients and change records is criminal or should be.  Clearly, Dr. Alexander had to find another career!If everything that was NOT descriptive of \"heaven\" or \"there\" were eliminated from the book AND ALL repetition used to describe \"heaven\"  were eliminated from the book there would be no more than a couple of paragraphs left in the whole book.More important than anything else is the author's claim that he was in communication with GOD.  Really!  Gee I think someone we all know who had been at the helm of government in 2001 also claimed having communicated with GOD.  And then invaded Iraq because of  WMD!Note also that the \"inky-black core\"  is in stark contrast to the extensive literature on LIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  The later stated \"inky darkness that was also full to brimming with light\" is not convincing.There is no proof of heaven here and I think Raymond A. Moody ought to be more careful on what books he has lent his good name to on the cover.Bravo to reviewer Inquiring Mind for the research on this author's sordid record as an MD.chezlouise",
